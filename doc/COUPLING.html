Itmust be followed by the keyword *KINEMATIC or*DISTRIBUTING.<P>The parameters REF NODE, SURFACE and CONSTRAINT NAME are mandatory, theparameter ORIENTATION is optional.<P>With REF NODE a reference node is chosen, the degrees of freedom of which areused to define the constraint. In the reference node six degrees of freedom areavailable: 1 to 3 for translations in the x-, y- and z- direction and 4 to 6for rotations about the x-, y- and z- axis. For *KINEMATIC couplings thelocation of the reference node determines the center of the rigid motion andis therefore important. For *DISTRIBUTING couplings the motion takes placeabout the center of gravity of the SURFACE and the coordinates of thereference node are not relevant. However, for *DISTRIBUTING coupling thereference node should not be one of the nodes of the surface to which the constraint applies.<P>With SURFACE the nodes are selected to which the constraint applies (so-calledcoupling nodes). This surface must be face-based.<P>The parameter CONSTRAINT NAME is used to assign a name to the couplingcondition. This name is not used so far.<P>Finally, with the ORIENTATION parameter one can assign a local coordinatesystem to the coupling constraint. Notice that this does not induce a changeof coordinate system in the reference node (for this a *TRANSFORM card isneeded). For distributing couplings only rectangular local systems areallowed, for kinematic couplings both rectangular and cylindrical systems arealllowed, cf. *ORIENTATION. <P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*COUPLING</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
