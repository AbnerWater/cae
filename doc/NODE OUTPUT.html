The options and its use are identical with the*NODE FILE keyword, however, the resulting .frd file is amixture of binary and ASCII (the .frd file generated by using *NODE FILE iscompletely ASCII). This has the advantage that the file is smallerand can be faster read by cgx.<P>If FILE and OUTPUT cards are mixed within one and the same step the last suchcardwill determine whether the .frd file is completely in ASCII or a mixture ofbinary and ASCII.<P><PRE>
Example:

*NODE OUTPUT,FREQUENCY=2,TIME POINTS=T1
RF,NT
</PRE><P>requests the storage of reaction forces and temperatures in the .frdfile every second increment. In addition, output will be stored for all timepoints defined by the T1 time points sequence.<P><P><P><BR>Example files: cubespring.<P></body></html>
