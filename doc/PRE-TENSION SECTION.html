There are three parameters: SURFACE, ELEMENT and NODE. Theparameter NODE is required as well as one of the parameters SURFACE andELEMENT. The latter two parameters are mutually exclusive.<P>With the parameter SURFACEan element face surface can be defined on which the pre-tension acts. Thisis usually a cross section of the bolt. This option is used for volumetricelements. Alternatively, the bolt can be modeled with just one linear beamelement (type B31). In that case the parameter ELEMENT is required pointing tothe number of the beam element. <P>The parameter NODE is used to define areference node. This node should not be used elsewhere in the model. Inparticular, it should not belong to any element. The coordinates of this nodeare immaterial. The first degree of freedom of this node is used to define apre-tension force with *CLOAD or a differential displacementwith *BOUNDARY. The force and the displacements areapplied in the direction of a vector, which is the normal to the surface ifthe SURFACE parameter is used and the axis of the beam element if the ELEMENTparameter is used. This vector can be defined underneath the *PRE-TENSION SECTION keyword. If the vector isspecified away from the elements whose faces belong to the surface (volumetriccase) or in the direction going from node 1 to node 2 in the elementdefinition (for the beam element), a positiveforce or positive displacements correspond to tension in the underlyingstructure. If no such vector is defined by the user, it is calculatedautomatically as the mean of the normals away from the elements whose faces belong to the surface(volumetric case) or as the vector extending from node 1 to node 2 (beam case).<P>Notice that in the volumetric case the surface must be defined by elementfaces, it cannot be defined by nodes. Furthermore, the user should make surethat <P><UL><LI>the surface does not contain edges or vertices of elements which do nothave a face in common with the surface. Transgression of this rule will leadto unrealistic stress concentrations.</LI><LI>the surface is not adjacent to quadratic elements the faces of which  belong to a contact surface. </LI></UL><P>Internally, the nodes belonging to the element face surface are copied and alinear multiple point constraint is generated between the nodes expressingthat the mean force is the force specified by the user (or similarly, the meandifferential displacement is the one specified by the user). Therefore, if theuser visualizes the results with CalculiX GraphiX, a gap will be noticed atthe location of the pre-tension section.<P>For beam elements a linear multiple point constraint is created between thenodes belonging to the beam element. The beam element itself isdeleted,i.e. it will not show up in the frd-file. Therefore, no other boundaryconditions or loads can be applied to such elements. Their only reason ofexistence is to create an easy means in which the user can define apretension. To this end the nodes of the beam element (e.g. representing abolt) should be connected by linear equations or a *DISTRIBUTING COUPLING cardto nodes of the structures to be held together.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*PRE-TENSION SECTION</LI><LI>Enter the NODE and the SURFACE or ELEMENT parameter and their values</LI></UL><P>Following line (optional):<UL><LI>First component in global coordinates of the normal on the surface</LI><LI>Second component in global coordinates of the normal on the surface</LI><LI>Third component in global coordinates of the normal on the surface</LI></UL><P><PRE>
