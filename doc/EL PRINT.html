Some of the element variables areprinted in the integration points, some are whole element variables.The following  variables can be selected:<UL><LI>Integration point variables<P><UL><LI>true (Cauchy) stress in structures (key=S). </LI><LI>viscous stress in CFD calculations (key=SVF). </LI><LI>strain (key=E). This is the total Lagrangian strain for (hyper)elasticmaterials and incremental plasticity and the total Eulerian strain for deformation plasticity.</LI><LI>strain (key=ME). This is the mechanical Lagrangian strain for (hyper)elasticmaterials and incremental plasticity and the mechanical Eulerian strain fordeformation plasticity (mechanical strain = total strain - thermal strain).</LI><LI>equivalent plastic strain (key=PEEQ)</LI><LI>equivalent creep strain (key=CEEQ; is converted internally into PEEQ  since the viscoplastic theory does not distinguish between the two;  consequently, the user will find PEEQ in the dat file, not CEEQ)</LI><LI>the energy density (key=ENER)</LI><LI>the internal state variables (key=SDV)</LI><LI>heat flux (key=HFL). This also applies to CFD-calculations involving  heat transfer.</LI></UL><P></LI><LI>Whole element variables<P><UL><LI>the internal energy (key=ELSE)</LI><LI>the kinetic energy (key=ELKE)</LI><LI>the volume (key=EVOL)</LI><LI>the heating power (key=EBHE)</LI></UL><P></LI></UL><P>The keys ENER and ELSE trigger the calculation of the internalenergy. If they areabsent no internal energy is calculated. Since in nonlinearcalculations the internal energy at any time depends on theaccumulated energy at all previous times, the selection of ENER and/orELSE innonlinear calculations (geometric or material nonlinearities) mustbe made in the first step.<P>There are six parameters, ELSET, FREQUENCY, FREQUENCYF, TOTALS, GLOBAL and TIME POINTS. The parameter ELSET is required, defining the set of elements for which these stresses should be printed. If this card is omitted, no values are printed. Several *EL PRINT cards can be used within one and the same step.<P>The parameters FREQUENCY and TIME POINTS are mutually exclusive. <P>The FREQUENCY parameter is optional and applies tononlinear calculations where a step can consist of severalincrements. Default is FREQUENCY=1, which indicates that the resultsof all increments will be stored. FREQUENCY=N with N an integerindicates that the results of every Nth increment will be stored. Thefinal results of a step are always stored. If you only want the finalresults, choose N very big. The value of N applies to *OUTPUT,*ELEMENT OUTPUT, *EL FILE, *ELPRINT, *NODE OUTPUT,*NODE FILE, *NODE PRINT,*SECTION PRINT,*CONTACT OUTPUT,*CONTACT FILE and *CONTACT PRINT. If the FREQUENCY parameter is usedfor more than one of these keywords with conflicting values of N, thelast value applies to all. A frequency parameter stays active across several stepsuntil it is overwritten by another FREQUENCY value or the TIME POINTS parameter.<P>The 3D fluid analogue of FREQUENCY is FREQUENCYF. In coupled calculationsFREQUENCY applies to the thermomechanical output, FREQUENCYF to the 3D fluid output.<P>The optional parameter TOTALS only applies to whole element variables. IfTOTALS=YES the sum of the variables for the whole element set isprinted in addition to their value for each element in the setseparately. If TOTALS=ONLY is selected the sum is printed but theindividual element contributions are not. If TOTALS=NO (default) theindividual contributions are printed, but their sum is not.<P>With the parameter GLOBAL (optional) you tell the program whether you would like theresults in the global rectangular coordinate system or in the local elementsystem. If an *ORIENTATION card is applied to the element at stake, this card definesthe local system. If no *ORIENTATION card is applied to theelement, the local system coincides with the global rectangularsystem. Default value for the GLOBAL parameter is GLOBAL=NO,which means that the results are stored in the local system. If you prefer theresults in the global system, specify GLOBAL=YES. If the results are stored inthe local system the first 10 characters of the name of the applicableorientation are listed at the end of the line.<P>With the parameter TIME POINTS a time point sequence can be referenced,defined by a *TIME POINTS keyword. In that case, output will beprovided for all time points of the sequence within the step and additionally at the end ofthe step. No other output will be stored and the FREQUENCY parameter is nottaken into account. Within a step only one time point sequence can be active. If more thanone is specified, the last one defined on any of the keyword cards*NODE FILE, *EL FILE, *NODE  PRINT,  *EL PRINT or *SECTION PRINT will be active. The TIMEPOINTS option should not be used together with the DIRECT option on theprocedure card.  The TIME POINTS parameters stays active across several stepsuntil it is replaced by another TIME POINTS value or the FREQUENCY parameter.<P>The first occurrence of an *EL FILE keyword card within a step wipesout all previous element variable selections for print output. If no*EL FILE card is used within a step the selections of the previousstep apply, if any.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*EL PRINT</LI><LI>Enter the parameter ELSET and its value.</LI></UL>Second line:<UL><LI>Identifying keys for the variables to be printed, separated by commas.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
