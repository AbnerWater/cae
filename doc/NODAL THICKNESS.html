There are no parameters. This keyword only makes sense for nodesbelonging to plane stress elements,  shellelements and beam elements. For all of these except for the beamelements one thickness value should be given. For plane stress andshell elements this is the thickness in normal direction. The normaldirection can be defined by using the *NORMALkeyword card. If none is defined, the normal is calculated based onthe geometrical data. For beamelements two thicknesses can be defined: one in 1-direction and one in2-direction. The 1-direction can be defined on the *BEAMSECTION card, the 2-direction by the*NORMAL card. <P>The *NODAL THICKNESS card takes precedence over any other thicknessdefinitions if the NODAL THICKNESS parameter was selected on the *BEAM SECTION or*SHELL SECTION card. Right now, it cannot be used forcomposite materials.<P>For structures in which axisymmetric elements (type CAX*) are present anythickness defined on the present card for plane stress and shell elements applies to 360<B><IMG WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img302.png" ALT="$ ^\circ$"></B>.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*NODAL THICKNESS</LI></UL><P>Following line:<UL><LI>Node or set of nodes previously defined</LI><LI>Thickness 1</LI><LI>Thickness 2</LI></UL><P><PRE>

*NODAL THICKNESS
22,0.05,0.08
</PRE><P>assigns to node 22 the thickness 0.05 and 0.08. Any plane stress orshell element containing node 22 will have a local thickness of 0.05unit lengths at node 22. Any beam element containingnode 22 will have a thickness of 0.05 unit length in local 1-directionand a thickness of 0.08 unit length in local 2-direction.<P><P><P><BR>Example files: shell1.<P></body></html>
