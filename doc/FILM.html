Notice that the labels 1 and 2 correspond tothe brick face labels of the 3D expansion of the shell (Figure 73).<P>for beam elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: in negative 1-direction</LI><LI>Face 2: in positive 1-direction</LI><LI>Face 3: in positive 2-direction</LI><LI>Face 5: in negative 2-direction</LI></UL>The beam face numbers correspond to the brick face labels of the 3Dexpansion of the beam (Figure 78).<P>Film flux characterized by a uniform film coefficient is entered bythe distributed flux type label Fx where x is the number of the face, followed by the sinktemperature and the film coefficient. If the filmcoefficient is nonuniform the label takes the form FxNUy and a user subroutine film.f must be provided specifying thevalue of the film coefficient and the sink temperature. The label can be up to 20 characters long. Inparticular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform film coefficientpatterns (maximum 16 characters).<P>In case the element face is adjacent to a moving fluid the temperature ofwhich is also unknown (forced convection), the distributed flux type label isFxFC where x is the number of the face. It is followed by the fluid nodenumber it exchanges convective heat with and the film coefficient. To define anonuniform film coefficient the label FxFCNUy must be used and a subroutinefilm.f defining the film coefficient be provided. The label can be up to 20 characters long. Inparticular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform film coefficientpatterns (maximum 14 characters).<P>Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, FILM AMPLITUDE and FILMTIME DELAY. OP takes the value NEW or MOD. OP=MOD is default andimplies that the film fluxes on different faces are kept over allsteps starting from the last perturbation step. Specifying afilm flux on a face for which such a flux was defined in aprevious step replaces this value. OP=NEW implies that all previousfilm flux is removed. If multiple *FILM cards are present in astep this parameter takes effect for the first *FILM card only. <P>The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitudeby which the sink temperature is scaled (mainly used for dynamiccalculations). Thus, in that case the sink temperature values entered on the *FILMcard are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At theend of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value atthat time. In subsequentsteps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or theamplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keepsits validity. The AMPLITUDE parameter has noeffect on nonuniform and forced convective fluxes.<P>The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAYmust be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which theAMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. Forinstance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>The FILM AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitudeby which the film coefficient is scaled (mainly used for dynamiccalculations). Thus, in that case the film coefficient values entered on the *FILMcard are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value.
