Thiscan be done using the keyword card *VIEWFACTOR. <P>There are six optional parameters: READ, WRITE, WRITE ONLY, NO CHANGE, INPUTand OUTPUT. READ/NO CHANGE and WRITE/WRITE ONLY are mutually exclusive,i.e. if you specify READ you cannot specify WRITE or WRITE ONLY and soon. These parameters are used to specify whether you want to readprevious viewfactors (READ/NO CHANGE) or store the viewfactors of the presentcalculation for future runs (WRITE and WRITE ONLY). For reading there is an optionalparameter INPUT, for writing there is an optional parameter OUTPUT. <P>If you specify READ or NO CHANGE, the results will be read from the binary file``jobname.vwf'' (which should have been generated in a previousrun) unless you use the parameter INPUT. In the latter case you canspecify any filename (maximum 126 characters) containing the viewfactors. Ifthe filename contains blanks, it must be delimited by double quotes and thefilename should not exceed 124 characters. The geometry of the faces exchanging radiation must be exactly the sameas in the actual run. Notice that the parameter INPUT must be preceded by theREAD or NO CHANGE parameter. The parameter NO CHANGE has the same effect asthe READ parameter except that it additionally specifies that theviewfactors did not change compared with the previous step. If this parameteris selected the LU decomposition of the radiation matrix is not repeated and alot of computational time can be saved. This parameter can obviously not beused in the first step of the calculation.<P>In thermal calculations (keyword *HEAT TRANSFER) theviewfactors are calculated at the start of each step since the user can changethe radiation boundary conditions in each step. If the viewfactors are notread from file, i.e. if there is no *VIEWFACTOR,READ or *VIEWFACTOR,NO CHANGE card in a step they arecalculated from scratch. In thermomechanical calculations (keyword*COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT)the viewfactors are calculated at the start of each iteration. Indeed, thedeformation of the structure in the previous iteration can lead to a change ofthe viewfactors. However, if the user reads the viewfactors from file the recalculation of the viewfactors in each iterationanew is turned off. In that case it is assumed that the viewfactors do notchange during the entire step.<P>If you specify WRITE or WRITE ONLY, the viewfactors will be stored in binary format infile ``jobname.vwf'' unless you use the parameter OUTPUT. In the latter caseyou can specify any filename (maximum 125 characters) in which the viewfactorsare to be written. Any existing file with this name will bedeleted prior to the writing operation.  Ifthe filename contains blanks, it must be delimited by double quotes and thefilename should not exceed 123 characters. Notice that the parameter OUTPUT must be preceded by theWRITE or WRITE ONLY parameter. If you specify WRITE ONLY the program stopsafter calculating and storing the viewfactors.<P>A *VIEWFACTOR card is only active in the step in which it occurs.<P><P><BR><P>First and only line:<UL><LI>*VIEWFACTOR</LI><LI>specify either READ or WRITE</LI></UL><P><PRE>
