All constants may be temperature dependent. The card should be preceded by an *ELASTIC card within the same material definition, defining the isotropic elastic properties of the material.<P>If the elastic data is isotropic, the large strain viscoplastic theorytreated in [73] and [74] is applied. If the elasticdata is orthotropic, the infinitesimal strain model discussed inSection 6.8.13 is used. Accordingly, for an elasticallyorthotropic material the hardening can be at most linear. Furthermore, if the temperaturedata points for the hardening curves do not correspond to the *ELASTICtemperature data points, they are interpolated at the latterpoints. Therefore, for an elastically isotropic material, it isadvisable to define the hardening curves at the same temperatures asthe elastic data.<P>Please note that, for each temperature, the (von Mises stress,equivalentplastic strain) data have to be entered in ascending order of the equivalentplastic strain.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*CYCLIC HARDENING</LI></UL><P>Following sets of lines defines the isotropic hardening curve:First line in the first set:<UL><LI>Von Mises stress.</LI><LI>Equivalent plastic strain.</LI><LI>Temperature.</LI></UL>Use as many lines in the first set as needed to define the complete hardening curve for this temperature.<P>Use as many sets as needed to define complete temperature dependence.<P><PRE>
