Blackbodyradiation is characterized by <!-- MATH $\epsilon=1$ --><B><IMG WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img103.png" ALT="$ \epsilon=1$"></B>. In CalculiX, the radiation isassumed to be diffuse (it does not depend on the angle under which itis emitted from the surface) and gray (it does not depend on thewavelength of the radiation). Selecting radiation type flux requiresthe inclusion of the *PHYSICAL CONSTANTS card, which specifies thevalue of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and the value of absolute zero in the user's units.In order to specify which face the flux is entering or leaving thefaces are numbered. The numbering depends on the element type.<P>For hexahedral elements the faces are numbered as follows (numbers arenode numbers):<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3-4</LI><LI>Face 2: 5-8-7-6</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-5-6-2</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-6-7-3</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-7-8-4</LI><LI>Face 6: 4-8-5-1</LI></UL><P>for tetrahedral elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3</LI><LI>Face 2: 1-4-2</LI><LI>Face 3: 2-4-3</LI><LI>Face 4: 3-4-1</LI></UL>and for wedge elements:<P><UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3</LI><LI>Face 2: 4-5-6</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-2-5-4</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-3-6-5</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-1-4-6</LI></UL><P>for quadrilateral plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 3: 3-4</LI><LI>Face 4: 4-1</LI><LI>Face N: in negative normal direction (only for plane stress)</LI><LI>Face P: in positive normal direction (only for plane stress) </LI></UL><P>for triangular plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 3: 3-1</LI><LI>Face N: in negative normal direction (only for plane stress)</LI><LI>Face P: in positive normal direction (only for plane stress) </LI></UL><P>for quadrilateral shell elements:<UL><LI>Face NEG or 1: in negative normal direction</LI><LI>Face POS or 2: in positive normal direction</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-4</LI><LI>Face 6: 4-1</LI></UL><P>for triangular shell elements:<UL><LI>Face NEG or 1: in negative normal direction</LI><LI>Face POS or 2: in positive normal direction</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-1</LI></UL>The labels NEG and POS can only be used for uniform, non-cavity radiation and are introducedfor compatibility with ABAQUS. Notice that the labels 1 and 2 correspond tothe brick face labels of the 3D expansion of the shell (Figure 73).<P>for beam elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: in negative 1-direction</LI><LI>Face 2: in positive 1-direction</LI><LI>Face 3: in positive 2-direction</LI><LI>Face 5: in negative 2-direction</LI></UL>The beam face numbers correspond to the brick face labels of the 3Dexpansion of the beam (Figure 78).<P>Radiation flux characterized by a uniform emissivity is entered bythe distributed flux type label Rx where x is the number of the face, followed by the sinktemperature and the emissivity. If the emissivity is nonuniform thelabel takes the form  RxNUy and a user subroutine radiate.f must be provided specifying thevalue of the emissivity and the sink temperature.  The label can be up to 17 characters long. Inparticular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform emissivitypatterns (maximum 13 characters).<P>If the user does not knowthe sink temperature but rather prefers it to be calculated from the radiationfrom other surfaces, the distributed flux type label RxCR should be used (CRstands for cavity radiation). In that case, the temperature immediatelyfollowing the label is consideredas environment temperature for viewfactors smaller than 1, what is lacking toreach the value of one is considered to radiate towards theenvironment. Sometimes, it is useful to specify that the radiation isclosed. This is done by specifying a value of the environment temperature which isnegative if expressed on the absolute scale (Kelvin). Then, the viewfactorsare scaled to one exactly. For cavity radiation thesink temperature is calculated based on the interaction of the surface atstake with all other cavity radiation surfaces (i.e. with label RyCR, y takinga value between 1 and 6). Surfaces for which no cavity radiation label isspecified are not used in the calculation of the viewfactor and radiationflux. Therefore, it is generally desirable to specify cavity radiationconditions on ALL element faces (or on none). If the emissivity is nonuniform,the label reads RxCRNUy and a subroutine radiate.f specifying the emissivitymust be provided. The label can be up to 17 characters long. Inparticular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform emissivitypatterns (maximum 11 characters). <P>Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, RADIATION AMPLITUDE,RADIATION TIME DELAY, ENVNODE and CAVITY. OP takes the value NEW or MOD. OP=MOD is default andimplies that the radiation fluxes on different faces are kept over allsteps starting from the last perturbation step. Specifying aradiation flux on a face for which such a flux was defined in aprevious step replaces this value. OP=NEW implies that all previousradiation flux is removed. If multiple *RADIATE cards are present in astep this parameter takes effect for the first *RADIATE card only. <P>The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitudeby which the sink temperature is scaled (mainly used for dynamiccalculations). Thus, in that case the sink temperature values enteredon the *RADIATE card are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At theend of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value atthat time. In subsequentsteps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or theamplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keepsits validity. The AMPLITUDE parameter has noeffect on nonuniform fluxes and cavity radiation.<P>The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAYmust be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which theAMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. Forinstance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>The RADIATION AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitudeby which the emissivity is scaled (mainly used for dynamiccalculations).

Forinstance, a RADIATION TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The RADIATION TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>The ENVNODE option applies for uniform radiation conditions only and allowsthe user to specify a sink node instead of a sink temperature. In that case,the sink temperature is defined as the temperature of the sink node. <P>Finally, the CAVITY parameter can be used to separate closed cavities. For thecalculation of the viewfactors for a specific face, only those faces areconsidered which:<P><UL><LI>are subject to cavity radiation</LI><LI>belong to the same cavity.</LI></UL><P>The name of the cavity can consist of maximum 3 characters (includingnumbers). Default cavity is '   ' (empty name). Since the calculation of theviewfactors is approximate, it can happen that, even if a cavity ismathematically closed, radiation comes in from outside. To prevent this, onecan define the faces of the cavity as belonging to one and the same cavity,distinct from the cavities other faces belong to.<P>Notice that in case an element set is used on any line following *RADIATE thisset should not contain elements from more than one of the following groups:{plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric elements}, {beams, trusses},{shells, membranes}, {volumetric elements}.<P>In order to apply radiation conditions to a surface the element set labelunderneath may be replaced by a surface name. In that case the ``x'' in theradiation flux type label takes the value zero.<P>If more than one *RADIATE card occurs in the input deck the following rulesapply: if a *RADIATE applies to the same node and the same face as in aprevious application then the prevous value and previous amplitude (includingradiation amplitude) are replaced.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*RADIATE</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value</LI></UL><P>Following line for uniform, explicit radiation conditions:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Radiation flux type label (Rx).</LI><LI>Sink temperature, or, if ENVNODE is active, the sink node.</LI><LI>Emissivity.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P>Following line for nonuniform, explicit radiation conditions:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Radiation flux type label (RxNUy).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P>Following line for cavity radiation conditions with uniform emissivity andsink temperature:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Radiation flux type label (RxCR).</LI><LI>Sink temperature, or, if ENVNODE is active, the sink node.</LI><LI>Emissivity.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P>Following line for cavity radiation conditions with nonuniform emissivity andsink temperature:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Radiation flux type label (RxCRNy).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>
