There aretwo required parameters: INTERACTION and TYPE, and two optionalparameters: SMALL SLIDING and ADJUST. The dependent surface is called the slave surface,the independent surface is the master surface. Surfaces are defined using the *SURFACE keyword card. The dependentsurface can be defined as a nodal surface (option TYPE=NODE on the *SURFACEkeyword) or as an element face surface (default for the *SURFACE card),whereas the independent surface has to be defined as an element facesurface. If you are using quadratic elements, or if you select face-to-facecontact, however,the slave surface has to be defined based on element faces and not on nodes.<P>If the master surface is made up of edges of axisymmetric elements make surethat none of the edges contains nodes on the axis of symmetry. Indeed, suchedges are expanded into collapsed quadrilaterals the normals on which cannotbe determined in the usual way.  <P>The INTERACTION parameter takes the name of the surface interaction (keyword*SURFACE INTERACTION) which applies to thecontact pair. The surface interaction defines the nature of the contact(hard versus soft contact..)<P>The TYPE parameter can take the value NODE TO SURFACE or SURFACE TOSURFACE. NODE TO SURFACE triggers node-to-face penalty contact, SURFACE TOSURFACE face-to-face penalty contact. Notice that although several *CONTACTPAIR cards can be used within one and the same input deck, all must be of thesame type. It is not allowed to mix NODE TO SURFACE and SURFACE TO SURFACEpenalty contact within one and the same input deck.<P>The SMALL SLIDING parameter only applies to node-to-face penalty contact. If it is not active, thecontact is large sliding. This means that the pairing between the nodesbelonging to the dependent surface and faces of the independent surface isperformed anew in every iteration. If the SMALL SLIDING parameter is active,the pairing is done once at the start of every increment and kept during thecomplete increment. SMALL SLIDING usually converges better than LARGE SLIDING, sincechanges in the pairing can deteriorate the convergence rate.<P>The ADJUST parameter allows the user to move selected slave nodes atthe start of the calculation (i.e. at the start of the first step) such that they make contact with the mastersurface. This is a change of coordinates, i.e. the geometry of the structureat the start of the calculation is changed. This can be helpful if due toinaccuracies in the modeling a slave node which should lie on the mastersurface at the start of the calculation actually does not. Especially instatic calculations this can lead to a failure to detect contact in the firstincrement and large displacements (i.e. acceleration due to a failure toestablish equilibrium). These large displacements may jeopardize convergence inany subsequent iteration. The ADJUST parameter can be used with a node set asargument or with a nonnegative real number. If a node set is selected, allnodes in the set are adjusted at the start of the calculation. If a realnumber is specified, all nodes for which the clearance is smaller or equal tothis number are adjusted. Penetration is interpreted as a negative clearanceand consequently all penetrating nodes are always adjusted, no matter howsmall the adjustment size (which must be nonnegative). Notice that largeadjustments can lead to deteriorated element quality. The adjustments are donealong a vector through the slave node and locally orthogonal to the master surface.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*CONTACT PAIR</LI><LI>enter the required parameter INTERACTION and any optional parameters.</LI></UL><P>Following line:<UL><LI>Name of the slave surface (can be nodal or element face based).</LI><LI>Name of the master surface (must be based on element faces).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>
