The values areadded to the initial strains already present in the model. The use of thisoption requires the previous use of *INITIAL  CONDITIONS, TYPE=PLASTIC STRAIN or *MODEL  CHANGE, TYPE=ELEMENT, ADD or  *MODEL  CHANGE, TYPE=ELEMENT, ADD=STRAIN FREE.<P>The resulting initial strain components are subtracted from thestrain components computed from the displacement field. If thermal strains arerelevant they are additionally subtracted. The resulting strain is used tocompute the stress and tangent stiffness matrix using the appropriateconstitutive equations.  <P>Please note that the strains have to be provided in theGLOBAL (rectangular) coordinate system, no matter whether an *ORIENTATION cardor *TRANSFORM card applies to the corresponding element.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*INITIAL STRAIN INCREASE</LI></UL><P><P><P><BR>Following line:<UL><LI>Element number.</LI><LI>Integration point number.</LI><LI>Value of first initial strain increase component (xx) in the GLOBAL coordinate  system x-y-z.</LI><LI>Value of second initial strain increase component (yy) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z.</LI><LI>Value of third initial strain increase component (zz) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z.</LI><LI>Value of fourth initial strain increase component (xy) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z.</LI><LI>Value of fifth initial strain increase component (xz) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z.</LI><LI>Value of sixth initial strain increase component (yz) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.
