Athermomechanical analysis is a nonlinear calculation in which thedisplacements and temperatures are simultaneously solved. In this way thereciprocal action of the temperature on the displacements and thedisplacements on the temperature can be taken into account. At the presentstate, the influence of the temperature on the displacements is calculatedthrough the thermal expansion, the effect of the displacements on thetemperature is limited to radiation effects. In addition, the influence of thenetwork fluid pressure on the deformation of a structure and the influence of thestructural deformation on the network fluid mass flow can be considered. Otherheating effects, e.g. due to plasticity, or not yet taken into account. This card is also correct forCFD-calculations with heat transfer.<P>There are eight optional parameters: SOLVER, DIRECT, ALPHA, STEADY STATE,DELTMX, TIME RESET, TOTAL TIME AT START and COMPRESSIBLE. <P>SOLVER determines thepackage used to solve the ensuing system of equations. The following solverscan be selected:<P><UL><LI>the SGI solver</LI><LI>PARDISO</LI><LI>SPOOLES [3,4]. </LI><LI>TAUCS </LI><LI>the iterative solver by Rank and Ruecker [65], which is based on  the algorithms by Schwarz [69]. </LI></UL><P>Default is the first solver which has been installed of the following list:SGI, PARDISO, SPOOLES and TAUCS. If none is installed, the default is the iterative solver, which comes with the CalculiXpackage.<P>The SGI solver should by now be considered as outdated. SPOOLES is very fast, but has noout-of-core capability: the size of systems you can solve is limited by yourRAM memory. With 2GB of RAM you can solve up to 250,000 equations. TAUCS isalso good, but my experience is limited to the <B><IMG WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1577.png" ALT="$ LL^T$"></B> decomposition, whichonly applies to positive definite systems. It has an out-of-core capabilityand also offers a <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1578.png" ALT="$ LU$"></B> decomposition, however, I was not able to run either ofthem so far. Next comes the iterative solver. If SOLVER=ITERATIVE SCALING isselected, the pre-conditioning is limited to a scaling of the diagonal terms,SOLVER=ITERATIVE CHOLESKY triggers Incomplete Choleskypre-conditioning. Cholesky pre-conditioning leads to a better convergence andmaybe to shorter execution times, however, it requires additional storageroughly corresponding to the non-zeros in the matrix. If you are short ofmemory, diagonal scaling might be your last resort. The iterative methodsperform well for truly three-dimensional structures. For instance,calculations for a hemisphere were about nine times faster with the ITERATIVESCALING solver, and three times faster with the ITERATIVE CHOLESKY solver thanwith SPOOLES. For two-dimensional structures such as plates or shells, theperformance might break down drastically and convergence often requires theuse of Cholesky pre-conditioning. SPOOLES (and any of the other direct solvers)performs well in most situations with emphasis on slender structures butrequires much more storage than the iterative solver. PARDISO is the Intel proprietary solver and is to my knowledgepresently the fastest.<P>The parameter DIRECT indicates that automatic incrementation should beswitched off. The increments will have the fixed length specified by the useron the second line.<P>The parameter ALPHA takes an argument between -1/3 and 0. It controls thedissipation of the high frequency response: lower numbers lead to increasednumerical damping ([54]). The default value is -0.05.<P>The parameter STEADY STATE indicates that only the steady state should becalculated. If this parameter is absent, the calculation is assumed to be timedependent and a transient analysis is performed. For a transient analysis thespecific heat of the materials involved must be provided. In a steady stateanalysis any loading is applied using linear ramping, in a transient analysisstep loading is applied.<P>The parameter DELTMX can be used to limit the temperature change in twosubsequent increments. If the temperature change exceeds DELTMX the incrementis restarted with a size equal to <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1608.png" ALT="$ D_A$"></B> times DELTMX divided by thetemperature change. The default for <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1608.png" ALT="$ D_A$"></B> is 0.85, however, it can be changedby the *CONTROLS keyword. DELTMX is only active intransient calculations. Default value is <B><IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1638.png" ALT="$ 10^{30}$"></B>.<P>The parameter TIME RESET can be used to force the total time at theend of the present step to coincide with the total time at the end of theprevious step. If there is no previous step the targeted total time iszero. If this parameter is absent the total time at the end of the present step is thetotal time at the end of the previous step plus the time period of the presentstep (2nd parameter underneath the *COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT keyword). Consequently, if the timeat the end of the previous step is 10. and the present time period is 1., thetotal time at the end of the present step is 11. If the TIME RESET parameteris used, the total time at the beginning of the present step is 9. and at theend of the present step it will be 10. This is sometimes useful iftransient coupled temperature-displacement calculations are preceded by a stationary heattransfer step to reach steady state conditions at the start of the transientcoupled temperature-displacement calculations. Using the TIME RESET parameter in the stationarystep (the first step in the calculation) will lead to a zero total time at the start of the subsequentinstationary step. <P>The parameter TOTAL TIME AT START can be used to set the total timeat the start of the step to a specific value.<P>Finally, the parameter COMPRESSIBLE is only used in 3-D CFD calculations. Itspecifies that the fluid is compressible. Default is incompressible.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values.</LI></UL><P><UL><LI>Initial time increment.
