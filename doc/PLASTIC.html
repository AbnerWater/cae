There is one optional parameterHARDENING. Default is HARDENING=ISOTROPIC, other values areHARDENING=KINEMATIC for kinematic hardening, HARDENING=COMBINED forcombined isotropic and kinematic hardening and HARDENING=USER for userdefined hardening curves. All constants may be temperaturedependent. The card should be preceded by a*ELASTIC card within the same material definition,defining the isotropic elastic properties of the material. Userdefined hardening curves should be defined in the user subroutineuhardening.f<P>If the elastic data is isotropic, the large strain viscoplastic theorytreated in [73] and [74] is applied. If the elasticdata is orthotropic, the infinitesimal strain model discussed inSection 6.8.13 is used. Accordingly, for an elasticallyorthotropic material the hardening can be at most linear. Furthermore, if the temperaturedata points for the hardening curves do not correspond to the *ELASTICtemperature data points, they are interpolated at the latterpoints. Accordingly, for an elastically orthotropic material, it isadvisable to define the hardening curves at the same temperatures asthe elastic data.<P>For the selection of plastic output variables the reader is referred toSection 6.8.7.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*PLASTIC</LI><LI>Enter the HARDENING parameter and its value, if needed</LI></UL><P>Following sets of lines define the isotropic hardening curve for HARDENING=ISOTROPIC and the kinematic hardening curve for HARDENING=KINEMATIC or HARDENING=COMBINED:First line in the first set:<UL><LI>Von Mises stress.</LI><LI>Equivalent plastic strain.</LI><LI>Temperature.</LI></UL>Use as many lines in the first set as needed to define the complete hardening curve for this temperature.<P>Use as many sets as needed to define complete temperature dependence.<P>For the definition of the isotropic hardening curve for HARDENING=COMBINED the keyword *CYCLIC HARDENING is used. <P><PRE>

The curve at T=273 connects the points (800.,0.), (900.,0.05) and (1000.,0.15), the curve at T=873 connects (700.,0.), (750.,0.04) and (800.,0.13). Notice that the first point on the curves represents first yielding and must give the Von Mises stress for a zero equivalent plastic strain.<P><P><P><BR>Example files: beampd, beampiso, beampkin, beampt.<P></body></html>
