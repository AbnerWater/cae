Combined hardening or user-defined hardening data are not allowed.<P>There is one optional parameterHARDENING. Default is HARDENING=ISOTROPIC, the only other value isHARDENING=KINEMATIC for kinematic hardening.

Noticethat it is not allowed to use more plastic strain data points or temperaturedata points than the amount used for the first definition of the plasticbehavior for this material (in the *PLASTIC card.<P>The raison d'&#234;tre for this card is its ability to switch from purely plasticbehavior to creep behavior and vice-versa. The viscoplastic for isotropicmaterials in CalculiX is an overstress model, i.e. creep only occurs above theyield stress. For a lot of materials this is not realistic. It is observed inblades and vanes that at high temperatures creep occurs at stresses well belowthe yield stress. By using the *CHANGE PLASTIC card the yield stress can belowered to zero in a creep (*VISCO) step following a inviscid (*STATIC)plastic deformation step. <P><PRE>
