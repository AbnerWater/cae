In these types of analysis the *BOUNDARY card for degree of freedom 11 should be used instead.  <P>Optional parameter are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, USER, SUBMODEL, STEP and DATA SET. OP can take the value NEW orMOD. OP=MOD is default and implies that thermal load in differentnodes is accumulated over all steps starting from the lastperturbation step. Specifying the temperature for a node for which atemperature was defined in a previous step replaces this lastvalue. OP=NEW implies that the temperatures are reinitialised to theinitial values. If multiple *TEMPERATURE cards are present in a stepthis parameter takes effect for the first *TEMPERATURE card only.<P>For shell elements a temperature gradient can be defined in additionto a temperature. The temperature applies to nodes in the referencesurface, the gradient acts in normal direction. For beam elements twogradients can be defined: one in 1-direction and one in2-direction. Default for the gradients is zero. <P>The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitudeby which the temperature isscaled (mainly used for dynamic calculations). Thus, in that case thevalues entered on the *TEMPERATURE card are interpreted as referencevalues to be multiplied with the (time dependent) amplitude value toobtain the actual value. At the end of the step the reference value isreplaced by the actual value at that time, for use in subsequentsteps.<P>The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAYmust be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which theAMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. Forinstance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>If the USER parameter is selected the temperature values are determined bycalling the user subroutine utemp.f, whichmust be provided by the user. This applies to all nodes listedbeneath the *TEMPERATURE keyword. Any temperature values specified behind thenodal numbers are not taken into account. If the USER parameter is selected,the AMPLITUDE parameter has no effect and should not be used.<P>The SUBMODEL parameter is used to specify that the nodes underneath the*TEMPERATURE card should get their temperature values by interpolation from aglobal model. Each of these nodes must be listed underneath exactly one nodal*SUBMODEL card. The SUBMODEL parameter automaticallyrequires the use of the STEP or DATA SET parameter.<P>In case the globalcalculation was a *STATIC calculation the STEP parameter specifies the step in the global modelwhich will be used for the interpolation. If results for more than oneincrement within the step are stored, the last increment is taken. <P>In case the global calculation was a *FREQUENCY calculation the DATA SET parameterspecifies the mode in the global model which will be used for theinterpolation. It is the number preceding the string MODAL in the .frd-fileand it corresponds to the dataset number if viewing the .frd-file withCalculiX GraphiX. Notice that the global frequency calculation is not allowedto contain preloading nor cyclic symmetry.<P>If the SUBMODEL card isused no temperature values need be specified. The SUBMODEL parameter and the AMPLITUDE parameterare mutually exclusive.  <P>Temperature gradients are not influenced by the AMPLITUDE parameter.<P>If more than one *TEMPERATURE card occurs in an input deck, the followingrules apply: if a *TEMPERATURE is applied to the same node as in a previousapplication then the previous value and previous amplitude are replaced.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*TEMPERATURE</LI><LI>enter any parameters, if needed.</LI></UL><P>Following line:<UL><LI>Node number or node set label.</LI><LI>Temperature value at the node.</LI><LI>Temperature gradient in normal direction (shells) or in2-direction (beams).</LI><LI>Temperature gradient in 1-direction (beams).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>
