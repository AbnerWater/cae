The parameters DOF andAMPLITUDE are required, the parameter TYPE is optional.<P>The prescribed boundary condition applies to the degree of freedom DOF in allnodes in which a homogeneous *BOUNDARY condition has been defined for thisdegree of freedom. If using *BASE MOTION it is good practice to define these*BOUNDARY conditions BEFORE the step in which *BASE MOTION is used, else theeffect may be unpredictable. The parameter DOF can only take the values in therange from 1 to 3. With the parameter AMPLITUDE the user specifies theamplitude defining the valueof the boundary condition. This amplitude must have been defined using the*AMPLITUDE card. <P>The TYPE parameter can take the string DISPLACEMENT or ACCELERATION. Defaultis ACCELERATION. Acceleration boundary conditions can only be used forharmonic steady state dynamics calculations, displacements can be used for anymodal dynamic or steady state dynamic calculation. Since only three degrees offreedom are at the user's disposal, defining more than three *base motioncards does not make sense.<P>The *BASE MOTION card is more restrictive than the *BOUNDARY card in the sensethat the same amplitude applies to a specific degree of freedom in all nodesin which a homogeneous boundary condition for exactly this degree of freedom has been defined. It is, however,less restrictive in the sense that for steady state dynamics calculations alsoaccelerations can be applied.<P><P><BR><P>First line and only line:<UL><LI>*BASE MOTION</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
