This is the only procedure in which this keyword card makes sense.  <P> There are two optional parameters STIFFNESS and OUTPUT FILE, and one required parameter FILE NAME.  <P> The optional parameters can only take a fixed value: STIFFNESS=YES and OUTPUT FILE= USER DEFINED. No other value is allowed.  <P> The required parameter FILE NAME is used to define the name of the file  in which the stiffness is to be stored. The extension .mtx is default and cannot be changed. It is automatically appended to the name given by the user.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*SUBSTRUCTURE MATRIX OUTPUT </LI> <LI>Enter the parameter FILE NAME and its name, and optionally, the   parameters STIFFNESS and OUTPUT FILE with their fixed values. </LI> </UL>  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*SUBSTRUCTURE MATRIX OUTPUT,FILE NAME=substruc
</PRE>  <P> defines file substruc.mtx for the storage of the substructure stiffness matrix.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: substructure.  <P> </body></html>
