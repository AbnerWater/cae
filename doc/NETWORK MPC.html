The corresponding degrees of freedomare:<P><UL><LI>total temperature: 0</LI><LI>mass flow: 1</LI><LI>total pressure: 2</LI></UL><P>The use of *NETWORK MPC requires the coding of subroutines networkmpc_lhs.fand networkmpc_rhs.f by the user. In these routines the user defines the MPC(linear or nonlinear)using the information entered underneath *NETWORK MPC. The syntax is identicalto *EQUATION except for an additional parameter TYPE  specifying the type of MPC. Using this type the user can distinguish between  different kinds of MPC in the networkmpc_lhs.f and networkmpc_rhs.f subroutines.<P>For instance, suppose the user wants to define a network MPC of the form:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><!-- MATH \begin{equation}f:=a p_{t} (node_1) + b p_t^2 (node_2)=0\end{equation} --><TABLE CELLPADDING="0" WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="CENTER"><TR VALIGN="MIDDLE"><TD NOWRAP ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="237" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1805.png" ALT="$\displaystyle f:=a p_{t} (node_1) + b p_t^2 (node_2)=0$"></TD><TD NOWRAP WIDTH="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">(494)</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><BR CLEAR="ALL"><P></P><P>specifying that the total pressure in node 1 should be (-b/a) times the squareof the totalpressure in node 2. There are 2 degrees of freedom involved: dof 2 in node 1and dof 2 in node 2. Underneath *NETWORK MPC the user defines thecoefficients and degrees of freedom of the terms involved:<P><PRE>

</PRE><P>All this information including the type of the MPC is transferred to thenetworkmpc_lhs.f and networkmpc_rhs.f subroutines. In networkmpc_rhs.f theuser has to code the calculation of -f, in networkmpc_lhs.f the calculationof the derivative of f w.r.t. each degree of freedom occurring in theMPC. This has been done for TYPE=QUADRATIC and the reader is referred to the source code andexample networkmpc.inp for further details.  <P></body></html>
