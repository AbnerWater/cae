The options and its use are identical with the*EL FILE keyword, however, the resulting .frd file is amixture of binary and ASCII (the .frd file generated by using *EL FILE iscompletely ASCII). This has the advantage that the file is smallerand can be faster read by cgx.<P>If FILE and OUTPUT cards are mixed within one and the same step the last suchcardwill determine whether the .frd file is completely in ASCII or a mixture ofbinary and ASCII.<P><PRE>
