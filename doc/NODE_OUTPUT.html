The options and its use are identical with the *NODE FILE keyword, however, the resulting .frd file is a mixture of binary and ASCII (the .frd file generated by using *NODE FILE is completely ASCII). This has the advantage that the file is smaller and can be faster read by cgx.  <P> If FILE and OUTPUT cards are mixed within one and the same step the last such card will determine whether the .frd file is completely in ASCII or a mixture of binary and ASCII.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*NODE OUTPUT,FREQUENCY=2,TIME POINTS=T1
RF,NT
</PRE>  <P> requests the storage of reaction forces and temperatures in the .frd file every second increment. In addition, output will be stored for all time points defined by the T1 time points sequence.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: cubespring.  <P> </body></html>
