A kinematic constraintspecifies that the displacement in a certain direction i at a node corresponds to therigid body motion of this node about a reference node. Therefore, the location of thereference node is important.<P>This card must be immediately preceded by a *COUPLINGkeyword card. If no ORIENTATION was specified on the *COUPLING card, thedegrees of freedom entered immediately below the *KINEMATIC card (these arethe degrees of freedom i which take part in the rigid body motion) apply to the global rectangular system, if an ORIENTATIONwas used, they apply to the local system. If the local system is cylindrical,the degrees of freedom 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the displacement in radialdirection, the circumferential angle and the displacement in axialdirection, respectively (as defined by the *ORIENTATION card; the position ofthe reference node is immaterial to that respect).<P>The degrees of freedom in the reference node (1 up to 3 for translations, 4 upto 6 for rotations; they apply to the global system unless a *TRANSFORM cardwas defined for the reference node) can be constrained by a*BOUNDARY card. Alternatively, a force (degrees offreedom 1 up to 3) or moment (degrees of freedom 4 up to 6) can beapplied by a *CLOAD card. In the latter case the resulting displacements(degrees of freedom 1 up to 3) can be printed in the .dat file by selecting U on the *NODE  PRINT card for the reference node. However, the corresponding selection of RFon the *NODE PRINT card does not work for the reference node. Instead, theuser should use *SECTION PRINT to obtain the globalforce and moment on the selected surface.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*KINEMATIC</LI></UL><P>Following line:<UL><LI>first degree of freedom (only 1, 2 or 3 allowed)</LI><LI>last degree of freedom (only 1, 2 or 3 allowed); if left blank the last  degree of freedom coincides with the first degree of freedom.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed to constrain other degrees of freedom.<P><PRE>

*BOUNDARY

</PRE><P>specifies a moment of size 0.01 about the z-axis through node 262. Therotation (angle) about this axis of each node belonging tothe facial surface SURF will be identical and such that the resulting momentin the structure agrees with the applied moment. Since only local degree offreedom 2 takes part in the rigid body motion, the radial and axialdisplacement in the nodes belonging to surface S1 is left completely free.<P><P><P><BR>Example files: coupling2, coupling3.<P></body></html>
