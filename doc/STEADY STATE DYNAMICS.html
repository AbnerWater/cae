Although the deformation up to the onset of thedynamic calculation can be nonlinear, this procedure is basically linear andassumes that the response can be written as a linear combination of the lowestmodes of the structure. To this end, these modes must have been calculated ina previous *FREQUENCY,STORAGE=YES step (not necessarily in the same calculation). In the*STEADY STATE DYNAMICS step the eigenfrequencies, modes, stiffness and massmatrix are recovered from the file jobname.eig. <P>For harmonic loading the steady state response iscalculated for the frequency range specified by the user. The number of datapoints within this range <B><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img605.png" ALT="$ n$"></B> can also be defined by the user, default is 20,minimum is 2 (if the user specifies <B><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img605.png" ALT="$ n$"></B> to be less than 2, the default is taken). Ifno eigenvalues occur within the specified range, this is the total number ofdata points taken, i.e. including the lower frequency bound and theupper frequency bound. If one or more eigenvalues fall within the specified range, <B><IMG WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1165.png" ALT="$ n-2$"></B>points are taken in between the lower frequency bound and the lowest eigenfrequencyin the range, <B><IMG WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1165.png" ALT="$ n-2$"></B> between any subsequent eigenfrequencies in the range and<B><IMG WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1165.png" ALT="$ n-2$"></B> points in between the highest eigenfrequency in the range and upperfrequency bound. Consequently, if <B><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img177.png" ALT="$ m$"></B> eigenfrequencies belong to the specifiedrange, <!-- MATH $(m+1)(n-2)+m+2=nm-m+n$ --><B><IMG WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1166.png" ALT="$ (m+1)(n-2)+m+2=nm-m+n$"></B> data points are taken. They are equally spacedin between the fixed points (lower frequency bound, upper frequency bound andeigenfrequencies) if the user specifies a bias equal to 1. If a different biasis specified, the data points are concentrated about the fixed points. Defaultfor the bias is 3., minimum value allowed is 1. (if the user specifies a valueless than 1., the default is taken).The number of eigenmodes used is taken from the previous *FREQUENCYstep. Since a steady state dynamics step is a perturbation step, all previous loadingis removed. Theloading defined within the step is multiplied bythe amplitude history for each load as specified by the AMPLITUDE parameter onthe loading card, if any. In this context the AMPLITUDE cards are interpretedas load factor versus frequency. Loading histories extending beyond the amplitudefrequency scale are extrapolated in a constant way. The absence of theAMPLITUDE parameter on a loading card leads to a frequency independent load.<P>For nonharmonic loading the loading across one period is not harmonic and hasto be specified in the time domain. To this end the user can specify thestarting time and the final time of one period and describe the loading withinthis period with *AMPLITUDE cards. Default is the interval <B><IMG WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1167.png" ALT="$ [0.,1.]$"></B> and steploading. Notice that for nonharmonic loading the *AMPLITUDE cards describeamplitude versus TIME. Furthermore, the user can specify the number of Fourierterms the nonharmonic loading is expanded in (default:20). The remaining input is the same as for harmonic loading, i.e. theuser specifies a frequency range, the number of data points within this rangeand the bias.<P>There are two optional parameters: HARMONIC and SOLVER. HARMONIC=YES (default)indicates that the periodic loading is harmonic, HARMONIC=NO specifiesnonharmonic periodic loading. The parameter SOLVER determines thepackage used to solve for the steady state solution in the presence of nonzerodisplacement boundary conditions.

SPOOLES is very fast, but has noout-of-core capability: the size of systems you can solve is limited by yourRAM memory. With 2GB of RAM you can solve up to 250,000 equations. TAUCS isalso good, but my experience is limited to the <B><IMG WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1577.png" ALT="$ LL^T$"></B> decomposition, whichonly applies to positive definite systems.
