A submodel is a part of abigger model for which an analysis has already been performed. A submodel isused if the user would like to analyze some part in more detail by using amore dense mesh or a more complicated material model, just to name a fewreasons. At those locations where the submodel has been cut from the globalmodel, the boundary conditions are derived from the global modelresults. These are the boundaries defined by the *SUBMODEL card. In addition,in a purely mechanical calculation it allows to map the temperatures to allnodes in the submodel (not just the boundary nodes).<P>There are four kinds of boundary conditions one may apply: the user may map thedisplacements from the global model (or temperatures in a purely thermalor a thermo-mechanical calculation ) to the boundaries of the submodel, the stressesto the boundaries of the submodel, the forcesto the boundaries of the submodel orthe user may select to map the temperatures in a purely mechanical calculationto all nodes belonging to the submodel. Mapping the stresses or forces may requirefixing a couple of additional nodes to prevent rigid body modes.<P>In order to perform the mapping (which is basically an interpolation) theglobal model is remeshed with tetrahedra. The resulting mesh is stored in fileTetMasterSubmodel.frd and can be viewed with CalculiX GraphiX.<P>There are three parameters of which two are required. The parameters TYPE andINPUT are required. TYPE can take the value SURFACE or NODE, depending onwhether the user wants to define stress boundary conditions or displacement/temperature/forceboundary conditions, respectively. The parameter INPUT specifies the file, inwhich the results of the global model are stored. This must be a .frd file.<P>A submodel of the SURFACE type is defined by element face surfaces. These mustbe defined using the *SURFACE,TYPE=ELEMENT card. Submodels of the NODE typeare defined by sets of nodes. It is not allowed to define a local coordinatesystem (with a *TRANSFORM card) in these nodes. Several submodel cards may be used in one andthe same input deck, and they can be of different types. The global resultfile, however, must be the same for all *SUBMODEL cards. Furthermore, a node(for the NODE type submodel) or an element face (for the SURFACE typesubmodel) may only belong to at most one *SUBMODEL.<P>The optional parameter GLOBAL ELSET defines an elset in the global model whichwill be used for the interpolation of the displacements or stresses onto thesubmodel boundary defined underneath the *SUBMODEL card. For the creation ofthis element set the parameter GENERATE is not allowed(cf. *ELSET). Although this element set contains elementnumbers belonging to the global model, it must be defined in the submodelinput deck using the *ELSET card. For instance, suppose the global modelcontains elements from 1 to 1000 and that the submodel contains only 10elements numbered from 1 to 10. Both models have no elements incommon, however, they may have element numbers in common (as is the case inthis example). Suppose that the global elements to be used for the interpolation ofthe boundary conditions onto the submodel have the numbers 600 up to 604. Then the followingcard defines the global elset<P><PRE>
*ELSET,ELSET=GLOBALSET1
600,601,602,603,604
</PRE><P>and has to be included in the submodel input deck, although in this deck onlyelements 1 to 10 are defined by a *ELEMENT card, i.e. inthe submodel input deck element numbers are referenced which are not at alldefined within the deck. This is fine for submodel decks only.<P>If no GLOBAL ELSET parameter is used thedefault GLOBAL ELSET is thecomplete global model. Global elsets of different *SUBMODEL cards may haveelements in common.<P>Notice that the *SUBMODEL card only states that the model at stake is asubmodel and that it defines part of the boundary to be of the nodal or ofthe surface type. Whether actually displacements or stresses will be appliedby interpolation from the global model depends on whether a*BOUNDARY, *DSLOAD,*CLOAD  or *TEMPERATURE, card is used, respectively, each of them accompanied by the parameter SUBMODEL.<P>Mapping displacements or temperatures to the boundary of a submodel is usuallyvery accurate. For stresses, the results may be unsatisfactory, since thestress values stored in the global model (and which are the basis for theinterpolation) are extrapolations of integrationpoint values. This frequently leads to a situation in which equilibrium forthe submodel is not satisfied. To circumvent this, the user may perform asubmodel analysis with displacement boundary conditions, store the forces atthe boundaries in the frd-file and use this file as global model for asubsequent submodel analysis with force boundary conditions. In this way acorrect force-driven analysis can be performed, for instance for crackpropagation analyses in the submodel (displacement-driven analyses prevent thecrack from growing).<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*SUBMODEL</LI><LI>Enter the parameters TYPE and INPUT and their value, and, if necessary,  the GLOBAL ELSET parameter.</LI></UL><P>Following line for TYPE=NODE:<UL><LI>Node or node set to be assigned to this surface (maximum 16 entries per line).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P>Following line for TYPE=SURFACE:<UL><LI>Element face surface (maximum 1 entry per line).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>

The nodes with number 1, 8 andthe nodes in the node set ``part'' belong to a Dirichlet part of the boundary, i.e. a part on which thedisplacements are obtained from the global model. The results of the globalmodel are stored in file global.frd. Whether they are reallyused, depends on whether a *BOUNDARY,SUBMODEL card is defined for these nodes.<P><P><P><BR>Example files: .<P></body></html>
