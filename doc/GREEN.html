The Green functions are calculated for each unit force separately. The unit forces are defined by a *CLOAD card (the force value specified by the user is immaterial, a unit force is taken). For details the user is referred to Section 6.9.23.  <P> There is one optional parameter: SOLVER. It determines the package used to solve the ensuing system of equations. The following solvers can be selected:  <P>  <UL> <LI>PARDISO </LI> <LI>SPOOLES [3,4].  </LI> </UL>  <P> Default is the first solver which has been installed of the following list: PARDISO, SPOOLES. If none is installed, a Green function calculation is not possible.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*GREEN </LI> <LI>Enter SOLVER, if needed, and its value. </LI> </UL>  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*GREEN,SOLVER=PARDISO
</PRE>  <P> defines a Green function step and selects the PARDISO solver as linear equation solver. For this to work, the PARDISO solver must have been linked with CalculiX.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: green1.  <P> </body></html>
