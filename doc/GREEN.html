The Green functions arecalculated for each unit force separately. The unit forces are defined by a*CLOAD card (the force value specified by the user isimmaterial, a unit force is taken). For details the user is referred to Section 6.9.23.<P>There is one optional parameter: SOLVER. It determines thepackage used to solve the ensuing system of equations. The following solverscan be selected:<P><UL><LI>PARDISO</LI><LI>SPOOLES [3,4]. </LI></UL><P>Default is the first solver which has been installed of the following list:PARDISO, SPOOLES. If none is installed, a Green function calculation is notpossible.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*GREEN</LI><LI>Enter SOLVER, if needed, and its value.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
