It only applies to face-to-face contact. If this option is active, the actual clearance oroverlapping based on the distance between the integration point on the slavesurface and its orthogonal projection on the master surface is overwritten bythe value specified here. There are three required parameters: MASTER, SLAVE andVALUE. With MASTER one specifies the master surface, with SLAVE the slavesurface and with VALUE the value of the clearance. Only one value per contactpair is allowed.<P><P><P><BR><P>First and only line:<UL><LI>*CLEARANCE</LI><LI>enter the required parameters and their values.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
