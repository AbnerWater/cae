The following variables can beselected:<P><UL><LI>Fluid dynamic drag stresses (key=DRAG), only makes sense for 3D fluid calculations</LI><LI>Heat flux (key=FLUX), only makes sense for heat calculations (structural  or CFD)</LI><LI>Section forces, section moments and section areas(key=SOF or key=SOM or key=SOAREA), only makes  sense for structural calculations</LI></UL><P>The drag stresses are printed in the integration points of the faces. Theoutput lists the element, the local face number, the integration point, thex-, y- and z- component of the surface stress vector in the global coordinate system,the normal component, the shear component and the global coordinates of theintegration point. At the end of the listing the surface stress vectors are integrated toyield the total force on the surface.<P>The heat flux is also printed in the integration points of the faces. Theoutput lists the element, the local face number, the integration point, theheat flux (positive = flux leaving the element through the surface defined bythe parameter SURFACE)  and the global coordinates of theintegration point. At the end of the listing the heat flux vectors areintegrated to yield the total heat flow through the surface.<P>The section forces, section moments and section areas are triggered by the keys SOF,SOM and SOAREA. All three keys are equivalent, i.e. asking for SOF (the section forces) willalso trigger the calculation of the section moments and the section areas. Thisimplementation was selected because the extra work needed to calculate themoments and areas once the forces are known is neglegible. The output lists <P><UL><LI>the components of the total surface force and moment about the origin in  global coordinates</LI><LI>the coordinates of the center of gravity and the components of the mean normal</LI><LI>the components of the moment about the center of gravity in global  coordinates</LI><LI>the area, the normal force on the section (+ is tension, - is  compression) and the size (absolute value) of the shear force.</LI></UL><P>Notice that, forinternal surfaces (i.e. surfaces which have elements on both sides) the signof the force and the moment depends on the side the elements of which wereselected in the definition of the *SURFACE. Please look atexample beamp.inp for an illustration of this.<P>There are four parameters,SURFACE, NAME, FREQUENCYF and TIME POINTS. The parameter SURFACE isrequired, defining the facial surface for which the requested items are to beprinted. The parameter NAME is required too, defining a name for the sectionprint. So far, this name is not used.<P>The parameters FREQUENCYF and TIME POINTS are mutually exclusive. <P>The parameter FREQUENCYF is optional, and applies tononlinear calculations where a step can consist of severalincrements. Default is FREQUENCYF=1, which indicates that the resultsof all increments will be stored. FREQUENCYF=N with N an integerindicates that the results of every Nth increment will be stored. Thefinal results of a step are always stored. If you only want the finalresults, choose N very big. The value of N applies to *OUTPUT,*ELEMENT OUTPUT, *EL FILE, *ELPRINT, *NODE OUTPUT,*NODE FILE, *NODE PRINT,*SECTION PRINT,*CONTACT OUTPUT,*CONTACT FILE and *CONTACT PRINT. If the FREQUENCYF parameter is usedfor more than one of these keywords with conflicting values of N, thelast value applies to all. A FREQUENCYF parameter stays active across several stepsuntil it is overwritten by another FREQUENCYF value or the TIME POINTS parameter.<P>With the parameter TIME POINTS a time point sequence can be referenced,defined by a *TIME POINTS keyword. In that case, output will beprovided for all time points of the sequence within the step and additionally at the end ofthe step. No other output will be stored and the FREQUENCYF parameter is nottaken into account. Within a step only one time point sequence can be active. If more thanone is specified, the last one defined on any of the keyword cards*NODE FILE, *EL FILE, *NODE  PRINT or *EL PRINT will be active. The TIMEPOINTS option should not be used together with the DIRECT option on theprocedure card. The TIME POINTS parameters stays active across several stepsuntil it is replaced by another TIME POINTS value or the FREQUENCYF parameter.<P>The first occurrence of an *SECTION PRINT keyword card within a step wipesout all previous facial variable selections for print output. If no*SECTION PRINT card is used within a step the selections of the previousstep apply, if any. <P>Several *SECTION PRINTcards can be used within one and the same step.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*SECTION PRINT</LI><LI>Enter the parameter SURFACE and its value.</LI></UL>Second line:<UL><LI>Identifying keys for the variables to be printed, separated by commas.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
