The TYPE of filter can be LINEAR, QUADRATIC or CUBIC. If no TYPE isspecified, no filtering will be active.<P>With BOUNDARY WEIGHTING=YES the sensitivities near the boundary between the designspace and the nodes not belonging to the design space are gradually decreasedto zero. The distance across which this happens can be specified by theuser. Default is no boundary weighting. If the BOUNDARY WEIGHTING parameter isactive but no boundary weighting distance is given (or zero) the filter radiusis taken is boundary weighting distance.<P>The EDGE PRESERVATION=YES parameter indicates that sharp corners at the boundaryof the design space should be kept. This means that for the calculation of thenormal on the design space, only the faces internal to the design space areused. Default is no edge preservation.<P>Finally, DIRECTION WEIGHTING=YES indicates that the values within the filterradius should be weighted with the scalar product of the local normal with thenormal at the center of the filter.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*FILTER and any appropriate parameters.</LI></UL><P>Second line (only necessary if TYPE and/or BOUNDARY WEIGHTING was selected):<UL><LI>the filter radius</LI><LI>the boundary weighting distance</LI></UL><P><PRE>
