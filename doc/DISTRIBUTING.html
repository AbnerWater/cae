A distributingconstraint specifies that a force or a moment in the reference node isdistributed among the nodes belonging to the element surface. The weights arecalculated from the area within the surface the reference node corresponds with.<P>The *DISTRIBUTING card must be immediately preceded by a *COUPLINGkeyword card, specifying the reference node and the element surface. If no ORIENTATION was specified on the *COUPLING card, thedegrees of freedom apply to the global rectangular system, if an ORIENTATIONwas used, they apply to the local system. For a *DISTRIBUTING constraint thelocal system cannot be cylindrical.<P>The degrees of freedom to which the distributing constraint should apply, haveto be specified underneath the *DISTRIBUTING card. They should belong to therange 1 to 6. Degrees of freedom 1 to 3 correspond to translations along thelocal axes, if any, else the global axes are taken. Degrees of freedom 4 to 6correspond to rotations about the local axes (4 about the local x-axis and soon), if any, else the global axes are taken. No matter what the userspecifies, the translations are always distributed (degree of freedom 1 to3). Consequently, the only freedom the user has is to decide whether anyadditional rotational degrees of freedom should be distributed.<P>The degrees of freedom in the reference node can be constrained by a*BOUNDARY card, or a corresponding force/moment can beapplied by a *CLOAD card. The displacements in the referencenode can be obtained by selecting U on the *NODE  PRINT card. The rotation about the reference node cannot beprinted. In order to obtain the force and/or moment in the reference node theuser should use *SECTION PRINT to obtain the globalforce and moment on the selected surface.<P>A *DISTRIBUTING coupling is usually selected in order to distribute a force or momentarea-weighted among the nodes of a surface. In case of a bending moment ortorque the rotation takes place about the center of gravity of thesurface. Nodes close to the center of gravity usually deteriorate theconvergence.<P>In CalculiX, the *DISTRIBUTING contraint is linear, i.e. the coefficients ofthe constraint are not updated during the calculation.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*DISTRIBUTING</LI></UL><P>Following line:<UL><LI>first degree of freedom (only 1 to 6 allowed)</LI><LI>last degree of freedom (only 1 to 6 allowed); if left blank the last  degree of freedom coincides with the first degree of freedom.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed to constrain other degrees of freedom.<P><PRE>
