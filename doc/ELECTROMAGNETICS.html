If transient, itmay be combined with a heat analysis. In that case the calculation is  nonlinear since the material properties depend on thesolution, i.e. the temperature.<P>There are seven optional parameters: SOLVER, DIRECT, MAGNETOSTATICS,DELTMX, TIME RESET and TOTAL TIME AT START and NO HEAT TRANSFER. <P>SOLVER determines thepackage used to solve the ensuing system of equations. The following solverscan be selected:<P><UL><LI>the SGI solver</LI><LI>PARDISO</LI><LI>SPOOLES [3,4]. </LI><LI>TAUCS </LI><LI>the iterative solver by Rank and Ruecker [65], which is based on  the algorithms by Schwarz [69]. </LI></UL><P>Default is the first solver which has been installed of the following list:SGI, PARDISO, SPOOLES and TAUCS. If none is installed, the default is the iterative solver, which comes with the CalculiXpackage.<P>The SGI solver should by now be considered as outdated. SPOOLES is very fast, but has noout-of-core capability: the size of systems you can solve is limited by yourRAM memory. With 2GB of RAM you can solve up to 250,000 equations. TAUCS isalso good, but my experience is limited to the <B><IMG WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1577.png" ALT="$ LL^T$"></B> decomposition, whichonly applies to positive definite systems. It has an out-of-core capabilityand also offers a <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1578.png" ALT="$ LU$"></B> decomposition, however, I was not able to run either ofthem so far. Next comes the iterative solver. If SOLVER=ITERATIVE SCALING isselected, the pre-conditioning is limited to a scaling of the diagonal terms,SOLVER=ITERATIVE CHOLESKY triggers Incomplete Choleskypre-conditioning. Cholesky pre-conditioning leads to a better convergence andmaybe to shorter execution times, however, it requires additional storageroughly corresponding to the non-zeros in the matrix. If you are short ofmemory, diagonal scaling might be your last resort. The iterative methodsperform well for truly three-dimensional structures. For instance,calculations for a hemisphere were about nine times faster with the ITERATIVESCALING solver, and three times faster with the ITERATIVE CHOLESKY solver thanwith SPOOLES. For two-dimensional structures such as plates or shells, theperformance might break down drastically and convergence often requires theuse of Cholesky pre-conditioning. SPOOLES (and any of the other direct solvers)performs well in most situations with emphasis on slender structures butrequires much more storage than the iterative solver. PARDISO is the Intel proprietary solver and is to my knowledgepresently the fastest.<P>The parameter DIRECT indicates that automatic incrementation should beswitched off. The increments will have the fixed length specified by the useron the second line.<P>The parameter MAGNETOSTATICS indicates that only the steady state should becalculated. Since the magnetic field does not change, no heat is produced anda heat transfer analysis does not make sense. The loading (coil current in theshell elements) is applied by itsfull strength. If theMAGNETOSTATICS parameter is absent, the calculation is assumed to be timedependent and a transient analysis is performed. A transient analysis triggersby default a complementary heat transfer analysis, thus thetemperature dependence of the properties of the materials involved must beprovided. Here too, the coil currents are bydefault applied by their full strength at the start of the step. Other loadingpatterns can be defined by an *AMPLITUDE card. <P>The parameter DELTMX can be used to limit the temperature change in twosubsequent increments. If the temperature change exceeds DELTMX the incrementis restarted with a size equal to <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1608.png" ALT="$ D_A$"></B> times DELTMX divided by thetemperature change. The default for <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1608.png" ALT="$ D_A$"></B> is 0.85, however, it can be changedby the *CONTROLS keyword. DELTMX is only active in transient calculations. Default value is <B><IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1638.png" ALT="$ 10^{30}$"></B>.<P>The parameter TIME RESET can be used to force the total time at theend of the present step to coincide with the total time at the end of theprevious step. If there is no previous step the targeted total time iszero. If this parameter is absent the total time at the end of the present step is thetotal time at the end of the previous step plus the time period of the presentstep (2nd parameter underneath the *HEAT TRANSFER keyword). Consequently, if the timeat the end of the previous step is 10. and the present time period is 1., thetotal time at the end of the present step is 11. If the TIME RESET parameteris used, the total time at the beginning of the present step is 9. and at theend of the present step it will be 10. This is sometimes useful iftransient heat transfer calculations are preceded by a stationary heattransfer step to reach steady state conditions at the start of the transientheat transfer calculations. Using the TIME RESET parameter in the stationarystep (the first step in the calculation) will lead to a zero total time at the start of the subsequentinstationary step. <P>The parameter TOTAL TIME AT START can be used to set the total timeat the start of the step to a specific value.<P>Finally, the paramter NO HEAT TRANSFER may be used in a transient analysis toindicate that no heat generated by the Eddy currents should becalculated. However, an external temperature field may be defined using the*TEMPERATURE card.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*ELECTROMAGNETICS</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values.</LI></UL><P>Second line:<UL><LI>Initial time increment.

The second line indicates that the initial time increment is .1 and the total step time is 1. Furthermore, the parameter DIRECT leads to a fixed time increment.
