The following variables can beselected (the label is squarebrackets [] is the one used in the .frd file; for frequency calculations withcyclic symmetry both a real and an imaginary part may be stored, in all other cases only thereal part is stored):<P><UL><LI>CDIS [CONTACT(real), CONTACTI(imaginary)]: Relative contact  displacements (for node-to-face contact in frequency calculations with  cyclic symmetry only for the base sector)</LI><LI>CSTR [CONTACT(real), CONTACTI(imaginary)]: Contact stresses (for node-to-face contact in frequency calculations with  cyclic symmetry only for the base sector)</LI><LI>CELS [CELS]: Contact energy</LI><LI>PCON [PCONTAC; submenu: O=opening, SL=slip, P=pressure, SH=shear stress]: Magnitude and phase of the relative contact  displacements and contact stresses in a frequency calculation with cyclic  symmetry. PCON can only be requested for face-to-face penalty contact.</LI></UL><P>Since contact is modeled by nonlinear springs the contact energy correspondsto the spring energy. All variables are stored at the slave nodes.<P>The relative contact displacements constitute a vector with threecomponents. The first component is the clearance, i.e. the distance betweenthe slave node and the master surface. Only negative values are stored; theycorrespond to a penetration of the slave node into the mastersurface. Positive values (i.e. a proper clearance) are set to zero. The secondand third component represent the projection of the relative displacementbetween the two contact surfaces onto the master surface. To this end twolocal tangential unitvectors are defined on the master surface; the first is the normalizedprojection of a vector along the global x-axis on the master surface. If theglobal x-axis is nearly orthogonal to the master surface, the projection of avector along the global z-axis is taken. Thesecond is the vector product of a vector locally normal to the master surfacewith the first tangential unit vector. Now, the components of the projectionof the relative displacement between the two contact surfaces onto the mastersurface with respect to the first and the second unit tangential vector arethe second and third component of CDIS, respectively. They are only calculatedif a friction coefficient has been defined underneath *FRICTION.<P>In the same way the contact stresses constitute a vector, the first componentof which is the contact pressure, while the second and third component are thecomponents of the shear stress vector exerted by the slave surface on themaster surface with respect to the first and second unit tangential vector, respectively.<P>The selected variables are stored for the complete model, but are only nonzeroin the slave nodes of contact definitions.<P>The first occurrence of a *CONTACT FILE keyword card within a step wipesout all previous nodal contact variable selections for file output. If no*CONTACT FILE card is used within a step the selections of the previousstep apply. If there is no previous step, no nodal contact variables will be stored.<P>There are four optional parameters: FREQUENCY, TIMEPOINTS, LAST ITERATIONS and CONTACT ELEMENTS. The parameters FREQUENCY andTIME POINTS are mutually exclusive. <P>FREQUENCY applies tononlinear calculations where a step can consist of severalincrements. Default is FREQUENCY=1, which indicates that the resultsof all increments will be stored. FREQUENCY=N with N an integerindicates that the results of every Nth increment will be stored. Thefinal results of a step are always stored. If you only want the finalresults, choose N very big. The value of N applies to*OUTPUT,*ELEMENT OUTPUT, *EL FILE, *ELPRINT, *NODE OUTPUT,*NODE FILE, *NODE PRINT,*SECTION PRINT, *CONTACT OUTPUT,*CONTACT FILE and *CONTACT PRINT. If the FREQUENCY parameter is usedfor more than one of these keywords with conflicting values of N, thelast value applies to all. A frequency parameter stays active across several stepsuntil it is overwritten by another FREQUENCY value or the TIME POINTS parameter.<P>With the parameter TIME POINTS a time point sequence can be referenced,defined by a *TIME POINTS keyword. In that case, output will beprovided for all time points of the sequence within the step and additionally at the end ofthe step. No other output will be stored and the FREQUENCY parameter is nottaken into account. Within a step only one time point sequence can be active. If more thanone is specified, the last one defined on any of the keyword cards*EL FILE, *ELPRINT, *NODE FILE, *NODE PRINT,*SECTION PRINT, *CONTACT FILE and *CONTACT PRINT will be active. The TIMEPOINTS option should not be used together with the DIRECT option on theprocedure card.  The TIME POINTS parameters stays active across several stepsuntil it is replaced by another TIME POINTS value or the FREQUENCY parameter.<P>The parameter LAST ITERATIONS leads to the storage of thedisplacements in all iterationsof the last increment in a file with name ResultsForLastIterations.frd (can be opened with CalculiX GraphiX). This isuseful for debugging purposes in case of divergence. No such file is created ifthis parameter is absent. <P>Finally, the parameter CONTACT ELEMENTS  stores the contact elements which havebeen generated in each iteration in a file with the namejobname.cel. Whenopening the frd file with CalculiX GraphiX these files can be read with thecommand ``read jobname.cel inp'' and visualized byplotting the elements in the setscontactelements_st<B><IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img138.png" ALT="$ \alpha$"></B>_in<B><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img762.png" ALT="$ \beta$"></B>_at<B><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img783.png" ALT="$ \gamma$"></B>_it<B><IMG WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img784.png" ALT="$ \delta$"></B>, where <B><IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img138.png" ALT="$ \alpha$"></B>is the step number, <B><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img762.png" ALT="$ \beta$"></B> the increment number, <B><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img783.png" ALT="$ \gamma$"></B> the attempt numberand <B><IMG WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img784.png" ALT="$ \delta$"></B> the iteration number.<P>Notice that CDIS and CSTR results are stored together, i.e. specifying CDISwill automatically store CSTR too and vice versa.<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*CONTACT FILE</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values.</LI></UL>Second line:<UL><LI>Identifying keys for the variables to be printed, separated by commas.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
