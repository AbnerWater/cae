PERTURBATION, NLGEOM, INC, INCF,THERMAL NETWORK and AMPLITUDE are the optional parameters. <P>The parameter PERTURBATION is allowed for *FREQUENCY, *BUCKLE, *GREEN and *STATIC stepsonly (for *STATIC steps it only makes sense for submodel frequencycalculations with preload, else a genuine nonlinear geometric calculation withNLGEOM is recommended). If it is specified, the last *STATIC step is taken as reference stateand used to calculate the stiffness matrix. This means the inclusion ofprevious deformations (large deformation stiffness) and the inclusion ofprevious loads as preloads (stress stiffness), taking the temperatures intoaccount to determine the material properties. The active loads (mechanical and thermal) are those specified in the perturbation step. At the end of the step the perturbation load is reset to zero.<P>The loading active in a non-perturbative step is the accumulation of the loading in all previous steps since but not including the last perturbation step (or, if none has occurred, since the start of the calculation), unless OP=NEW has been specified since.<P>If NLGEOM is specified, the calculation takes geometrically nonlinear effectsinto account. To this end a nonlinear strain tensor is used (Lagrangian strainfor hyperelastic materials, Eulerian strain for deformation plasticity and thedeviatoric elastic left Cauchy-Green tensor for incremental plasticity), thestep is divided into increments and a Newton iteration is performed withineach increment (notice that iterations are also performed for other kinds ofnonlinearity, such as material nonlinearity or contact conditions). Although the internally used stresses are the Piola stressesof the second kind, they are transformed into Cauchy (true) stresses beforebeing printed. NLGEOM is only taken into account if the procedure card (suchas *STATIC, *DYNAMIC, *COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT) allows for it (the*FREQUENCY card, for example, does not directly allow for it). Once the NLGEOMparameter has been selected, it remains active in all subsequent staticcalculations. With NLGEOM=NO the inclusion of geometrically nonlinear effectscan be turned off. It stays active in subsequent steps as well, unless NLGEOMwas specified again. To check whether geometric nonlinearity was taken intoaccount in a specific step, look for the message ``Nonlinear geometric effectsare taken into account'' in the output.<P>The step sizeand the increment size can be specified underneath the procedure card. The maximumnumber of increments in the step (for automatic incrementation) can bespecified by using the parameter INC (default is 100) for thermomechanicalcalculations and INCF (default is 10000) for 3D fluid calculations. In coupledfluid-structure calculations INC applies to the thermomechanical part of thecomputations and INCF to the 3D fluid part.<P>The option THERMAL NETWORK allows the user to perform fast thermalcalculations despite the use of specific network elements (e.g. gas pipers,labyrinths etc), which are characterized by a TYPE description on the*FLUID SECTION card. In general, the use of specificnetwork elements triggers the alternating solution of the network and thestructure, leading to longer computational times. In thermal calculations withonly generic network elements (no TYPE specified on the *FLUID SECTION cards),the temperatures in the network are solved simulaneously with thetemperatures on the structural side (which is much faster than the alternatingway). Now, sometimes the user would like to usespecific elements, despite the fact that only temperatures have to becalculated, e.g. in order to determine the heat transfer coefficients based onflow characteristics such as Prandl and Reynolds number (this requires the useof the user film routine film.f). Specifying THERMAL NETWORK on the FIRST*STEP card in the input deck takes care that in such a case the simulaneoussolving procedure is used instead of the alternating one.<P>Finally, the parameter AMPLITUDE can be used to define whether the loading inthis step should be ramped (AMPLITUDE=RAMP) or stepped (AMPLITUDE=STEP). Withthis option the default for the procedure can be overwritten. For example, thedefault for a *STATIC step is RAMP. By specifying AMPLITUDE=STEP the loadingin the static step is applied completely at the beginning of the step. Note,however, that amplitudes on the individual loading cards (such as *CLOAD, *BOUNDARY....) take precedence.<P><P><BR><P>First and only line:<UL><LI>*STEP</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values</LI></UL><P><PRE>
