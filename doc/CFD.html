If this parameter is absent, the calculation is assumed to be timedependent and a transient analysis is performed. <P>The initial time increment and time step period are interpreted mechanicaltime increment and mechanical time step. For each mechanical time increment aCFD calculation is performed consisting of several CFD timeincrements. Therefore, the initial CFD time increment cannot exceed theinitial mechanical time increment. CFD time increments are usually muchsmaller than the mechanical time increments. The CFD calculation is performedup to the end of the mechanical time increment (if the calculation istransient) or up to steady state conditions (if the CFD calculation is asteady state calculation).<P>The parameter TIME RESET can be used to force the total time at theend of the present step to coincide with the total time at the end of theprevious step. If there is no previous step the targeted total time iszero. If this parameter is absent the total time at the end of the present step is thetotal time at the end of the previous step plus the time period of the presentstep (2nd parameter underneath the *CFD keyword). Consequently, if the timeat the end of the previous step is 10. and the present time period is 1., thetotal time at the end of the present step is 11. If the TIME RESET parameteris used, the total time at the beginning of the present step is 9. and at theend of the present step it will be 10. This is sometimes useful iftransient coupled temperature-displacement calculations are preceded by a stationary heattransfer step to reach steady state conditions at the start of the transientcoupled temperature-displacement calculations. Using the TIME RESET parameter in the stationarystep (the first step in the calculation) will lead to a zero total time at the start of the subsequentinstationary step. <P>The parameter TOTAL TIME AT START can be used to set the total timeat the start of the step to a specific value.<P>The parameter COMPRESSIBLE specifies that the fluid is compressible. Default is incompressible.<P>For 3D fluid calculations the parameter TURBULENCE MODEL defines theturbulence model to be used. The user can choose among NONE (laminarcalculations; this is default), K-EPSILON, K-OMEGA and SST [49].<P>The parameter SCHEME is only important for compressible fluids. It selects thescheme to be used to calculate the facial quantities from the element centerquantities for the convective terms in the governing equations. Right now, theuser can choose between upwind difference (SCHEME=UD, default) and modified smart(SCHEME=MODSMART). Upwind difference has more false diffusion, however, thestability is better. Modified smart is a so called high resolution scheme[59]. It has less false diffusion but may lead to divergence insome cases. If modified smart does not diverge, it will give betterresults. For incompressible fluids a Gamma scheme [35] is used. Thiscannot be influenced by the user. It is also a high resolution scheme.<P>Finally, the parameter SIMPLEC indicates, if selected, that the SIMPLECalgorithm is to be used rather than the standard SIMPLE. Right now, theSIMPLECscheme can only be selected for compressible flow. It usually leads to fasterconvergence [59].<P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*CFD</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values.</LI></UL><P><UL><LI>Initial time increment.
