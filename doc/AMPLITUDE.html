The amplitude history should be given in pairs, each pairconsisting of a value of the reference time and the corresponding value of theamplitude or by user subroutine uamplitude.f. <P>There are four optional parameters TIME, USER, SHIFTX and SHIFTY and one required parameter NAME.Ifthe parameter TIME=TOTAL TIME is used the reference time is the totaltime since the start of the calculation, else it is the local steptime. Use as many pairs as needed, maximum four per line. <P>The parameter USER indicates that the amplitude history versus time was implemented inuser subroutine uamplitude.f. No pair data is required. <P>With the parameters SHIFTX and SHIFTY the reference time and the amplitude ofthe (time,amplitude) pairs can be shifted by a fixed amount.<P>The parameter NAME,specifying a name for the amplitude so that it can be used in loadingdefinitions (*BOUNDARY, *CLOAD, *DLOAD and *TEMPERATURE) is required (maximum80 characters).<P>In each step, the local step time starts at zero. Its upper limit isgiven by the time period of the step. This time period is specified onthe *STATIC, *DYNAMIC or *MODAL DYNAMIC keyword card. The default steptime period is 1. <P>In *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS steps the time is replaced by frequency, i.e. the*AMPLITUDE is interpreted as amplitude versus frequency (in cycles/time). <P>The total time is the time accumulated until the beginning of the actual step augmentedby the local step time. In *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS procedures total timecoincides with frequency (in cycles/time).<P>The loading values specified in the loading definitions (*BOUNDARY, *CLOAD,*DLOAD and *TEMPERATURE) are reference values. If an amplitude is selected ina loading definition, the actual load value is obtained by multiplying thereference value with the amplitude for the actual (local step or total)time. If no amplitude is specified, the actual load value depends on theprocedure: for a *STATIC procedure, ramp loading is assumed connecting theload value at the end of the previous step (0 if there was none) to thereference value at the end of the present step in a linear way. For *DYNAMICand *MODAL DYNAMIC procedures, step loading is assumed, i.e. the actual loadequals the reference load for all time instances within the step. Referenceloads which are not changed in a new step remain active, their amplitudedescription, however, becomes void, unless the TIME=TOTAL TIME parameter isactivated. Beware that at the end of a step, all reference values for which anamplitude was specified are replaced by their actual values at that time.<P>Notice that no different amplitude definitions are allowed ondifferent degrees of freedom in one and the same node if a non-globalcoordinate system applied to that node. For instance, if you define acylindrical coordinate system for a node, the amplitude for a force in radialdirection has to be the same as for the tangential and axial direction.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*AMPLITUDE</LI><LI>Enter the required parameter.</LI></UL><P>Following line, using as many entries as needed (unless the parameter USER wasselected):<UL><LI>Time.</LI><LI>Amplitude.</LI><LI>Time.</LI><LI>Amplitude.</LI><LI>Time.</LI><LI>Amplitude.</LI><LI>Time.</LI><LI>Amplitude.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if more than eight entries (four data points) are needed.<P><PRE>
