A surface interaction data block is defined by the options between a *SURFACE INTERACTION line and either another *SURFACE INTERACTION line or a keyword line that does not define surface interaction properties. All surface interaction options within a data block will be assumed to define the same surface interaction. If a property is defined more than once for a surface interaction, the last definition is used. There is one required parameter, NAME, defining the name of the surface interaction with which it can be referenced in surface interactions (e.g. *CONTACT PAIR). The name can contain up to 80 characters.  <P> If used for penalty contact the surface interaction definition must contain a *SURFACE BEHAVIOR card.  <P> Surface interaction data requests outside the defined ranges are extrapolated in a constant way. Be aware that this occasionally occurs due to rounding errors.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*SURFACE INTERACTION </LI> <LI>Enter the NAME parameter and its value. </LI> </UL>  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*SURFACE INTERACTION,NAME=SI1
