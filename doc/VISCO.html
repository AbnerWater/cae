The syntax is identical to the *STATICsyntax, except for the extra parameter CETOL. This parameter is required anddefines the maximum difference in viscous strain within a timeincrement based on the viscous strain rate at the start and the end of the increment. To get an idea of its size one can divide the stress increase onewould typically allow within a time increment by the E-modulus.<P>Although the specification of the CETOL parameter is mandatory, it is onlyused so far for materials for which the elastic behavior is linear and isotropic.<P>Notice that the default way of applying loads in a *VISCO step is steploading, i.e. the loading is fully applied at the start of the step. This isdifferent from a *STATIC step, in which the loading is ramped. Using a *VISCOstep only makes sense if at least one materials exhibits viscous behavior.<P></body></html>
