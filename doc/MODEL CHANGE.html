Before the first step all elements are by defaultactivated. There is one required parameter TYPE=ELEMENT and there are twomutually exclusive parameters ADD and REMOVE. The ADD parameter can becomplemented by the modifiers STRAIN FREE or WITH STRAIN (ADD=STRAIN FREE andADD=WITH STRAIN, respectivily). If ADD=STRAIN FREE is selected the strains atthe time of adding the element, if any, are modified by artificial initialstrains such that the resulting stress tensor is zero. In that sense theelements are stress free rather than strain free. With ADD=WITH STRAIN thestrains at the time of activation are not modified. Default is STRAIN FREE.<P>To activate or deactivate contact between twosurfaces, contact must have been defined between these surfaces using a*CONTACT PAIR card before the first step. By defaultall contact pairs are activated before the first step. There is onerequired parameter TYPE=CONTACT PAIR and there are two mutually exclusiveparameters ADD and REMOVE.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*MODEL CHANGE</LI><LI>enter the required parameter TYPE=CONTACT PAIR or TYPE=ELEMENT and one of the mutually  exclusive parameters ADD and REMOVE.</LI></UL><P>Following line for TYPE=ELEMENT:<UL><LI>List of elements and/or sets of elements to be activated or deactivated  (maximum 16 entries per line).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed<P>Following line for TYPE=CONTACT PAIR:<UL><LI>Name of the slave surface (can be nodal or element face based).</LI><LI>Name of the master surface (must be based on element faces).</LI></UL><P><PRE>
