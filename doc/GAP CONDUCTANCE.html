The conductance is the ratio of the heat flow across the contactlocation and the temperature difference between the corresponding slave andmaster surface (unit: [energy]/([time]*[area]*[temperature])). The gap conductance is a property of the nonlinear contactspring elements generated during contact. This means that heat flow will onlytake place at those slave nodes, at which a contact spring element wasgenerated. Whether or not a contact spring element is generated depends on thepressure-overclosure relationship on the *SURFACE  BEHAVIOR card. <P><UL><LI>for node-to-face contact:<UL><LI>if the pressure-overclosure relationship is linear or tabular a contact spring  element is generated if the gap clearance does not exceed <!-- MATH $c_0\sqrt{A}$ --><B><IMG WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1727.png" ALT="$ c_0\sqrt{A}$"></B>, where A is the representative area at the slave node, or  <B><IMG WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img778.png" ALT="$ 10^{-10}$"></B> if this area is zero (can happen for 2-dimensional  elements).

Alternatively,the conductance can be coded by the user in the user subroutine gapcon.f, cfSection 8.4.11.
