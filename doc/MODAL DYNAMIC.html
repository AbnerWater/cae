Although the deformation up to the onset of the dynamiccalculation can be nonlinear, this procedure is basically linear and assumesthat the response can be written as a linear combination of the lowest modesof the structure. To this end, these modes must have been calculated in aprevious *FREQUENCY,STORAGE=YES step (not necessarily in the samecalculation). In the *MODAL DYNAMIC step the eigenfrequencies, modes and massmatrix are recovered from the file jobname.eig. The time period of the loadingis characterized by its total length and the length of an increment. Withineach increment the loading is assumed to be linear, in which case the solutionis exact apart from modeling inaccuracies and the fact that not all eigenmodesare used. The number of eigenmodes used is taken from the previous *FREQUENCYstep. Since a modal dynamic step is a perturbation step, all previous loadingis removed. The loading defined within thestep is multiplied by the amplitude history for each load as specified by theAMPLITUDE parameter on the loading card, if any. If no amplitude applies allloading is applied at the start of the step. Loading histories extending beyond the amplitude time scale are extrapolated in a constant way. The absence of the AMPLITUDE parameter on a loading card leads to a constant load.<P>There are four optional parameters: SOLVER, DIRECT, DELTMX, and STEADY STATE. SOLVER determines thepackage used to solve for the steady state solution in the presence of nonzerodisplacement boundary conditions. The following solverscan be selected:<P><UL><LI>the SGI solver</LI><LI>PARDISO</LI><LI>SPOOLES [3,4]. </LI><LI>TAUCS </LI></UL><P>Default is the first solver which has been installed of the following list:SGI, PARDISO, SPOOLES and TAUCS. If none is installed, an error is issued.<P>The SGI solver should by now be considered as outdated. SPOOLES is very fast, but has noout-of-core capability: the size of systems you can solve is limited by yourRAM memory. With 2GB of RAM you can solve up to 250,000 equations. TAUCS isalso good, but my experience is limited to the <B><IMG WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1577.png" ALT="$ LL^T$"></B> decomposition, whichonly applies to positive definite systems. It has an out-of-core capabilityand also offers a <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1578.png" ALT="$ LU$"></B> decomposition, however, I was not able to run either ofthem so far. PARDISO is the Intel proprietary solver and is to my knowledgepresently the fastest.<P>The parameters DIRECT and DELTMX are linked. The parameter DIRECT controls theincrement size. If DIRECT=NO the size of increments is variable. It is determined by the requirement that the change inforces within an increment should not exceed the value ofDELTMX. Therefore, if the user specifies DIRECT=NO a value for DELTMX has tobe provided. Default is DIRECT=YES (or, equivalently DIRECT without anyargument). In the latter case the value of DELTMX isirrelevant. The modal forces are the scalar product of the system force vectorwith each of the selected (mass normalized) eigenmodes. The unit of the modalforces is force times square root of length.<P>The parameter STEADY STATE can be used to continue a modal dynamicscalculation until steady state has been reached. In that case the total timeperiod is set to <B><IMG WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1801.png" ALT="$ 10.^{10} $"></B> and does not have to be specified by theuser. Instead, the user defines the maximum allowable relative error for thesolution to be considered to be steady state. For instance, if the user setsthis number to <B><IMG WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1802.png" ALT="$ 0.01$"></B> steady state will be reached if the change in thelargest solution variable (displacements or temperatures, depending on thekind of analysis) does not exceed <B><IMG WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="img1803.png" ALT="$ 1 \%$"></B>. <P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*MODAL DYNAMIC</LI><LI>enter the SOLVER parameter and its value, if needed.</LI></UL>Second line if STEADY STATE is not active:<UL><LI>Initial time increment.
