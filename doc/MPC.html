The first threenodes are the defining nodes and should not lie on a line. For allsubsequent nodes a nonlinear MPC is generated expressing that theystay within the plane. Notice that the plane can move duringdeformation, depending on the motion of the defining nodes.<P></LI><LI>A straight line MPC (name STRAIGHT). This MPC expresses that allnodes listed within this MPC card should stay on a straight line. Thefirst two nodes are the defining nodes and should not coincide. Forall subsequent nodes two nonlinear MPC's are generated expressing thatthey stay on the straight line. Notice that the straight line can moveduring deformation, depending on the motion of its defining nodes.<P></LI><LI>A beam MPC (name BEAM). This MPC involves exactly two nodes the distance between  which is kept constant during the calculation.<P></LI><LI>A user MPC (name to be defined by the user). With this optionthe user can define new nonlinear MPC's. Examples are given in Section8.7, e.g. the mean rotation MPC.</LI></UL><P>A *MPC card automatically triggers the NLGEOM parameter, i.e. a geometricallynonlinear calculation is performed, except if the MPC is a mean rotation MPC.<P>There are no parameters for this keyword card.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*MPC</LI></UL><P>Second line:<UL><LI>MPC name</LI><LI>list of nodes participating in the MPC: maximum 15 entries.
