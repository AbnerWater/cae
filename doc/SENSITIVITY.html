There are threeoptional parameters: NLGEOM, READ and WRITE. If NLGEOM is active, the change of the stiffness matrixw.r.t. the design variables is performed based on:<P><UL><LI>a material tangent stiffness matrix at the strain at the end of the  previous static step</LI><LI>displacements at the end of the previous static step (large deformation  stiffness)</LI><LI>the stresses at the end of the previous static step (stress stiffness)</LI></UL><P>It makes sense to include NLGEOM if it was used on a previous static step andnot to include it if it was not used on a prevous static step or in theabsense of any prevous static step.<P>The parameters READ and WRITE are mutually exclusive and can only be used ifthe coordinates are the design variables. If WRITE is selected,the ``raw'' sensitivities (i.e. without filtering or any other action definedunderneath the *FILTER card) for all design nodes are stored in file jobname.sen inascending order of the design node numbers. If READ is selected the rawsensitivities are read from file jobname.sen. They can be further processed byfiltering etc.<P>Notice that the objective functions SHAPE ENERGY, MASS, DISPLACEMENT and STRESSrequire a previous *STATIC step, the objective GREEN requires a previous*GREEN step and the objective EIGENFREQUENCY requires a previous *FREQUENCYstep, possibly preceded by a *STATIC step, cf. *OBJECTIVE.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*SENSITIVITY</LI><LI>Enter the NLGEOM parameter if needed.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
