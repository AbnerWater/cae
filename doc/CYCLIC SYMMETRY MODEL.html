The axis of symmetry is defined by two points a and b, defined in global Cartesian coordinates.<P>For structural calculations there are five parameters, N, NGRAPH, TIE, ELSET and CHECK. The parameter N,specifying the number of sectors, is required, TIE is required if more thanone cyclic symmetry tie is defined.<P>The parameter NGRAPH is optional and indicates for how many sectors thesolutions should be stored in .frd format. Setting NGRAPH=N for N sectorsstores the solution for the complete structure for subsequent plottingpurposes. Default is NGRAPH=1.  Therotational direction for the multiplication of the datum sector is from thedependent surface (slave) to the independent surface (master).<P>The parameter TIE specifies the name of the tie constraint to which the cyclic symmetrymodel definition applies. It need not be specified if only one *TIE card hasbeen defined.<P>The element set specified by ELSET specifies the elements to which theparameter NGRAPH should be applied. Default if only one *TIE card was used isthe complete model. <P>The last parameter, CHECK, specifies whether CalculiX should compare thesector angle based on its geometry with its value based on N. If the deviationexceeds 0.01 radians the program issues an error message and stops. If CHECK=NO isspecified, the check is not performed, else it is. If the user wants to findeigenmodes with fractional nodal diameters, i.e. vibrations for which thephase shift is smaller than the sector angle, a value of N has to be specifiedwhich exceeds the number of sectors in the model. In that case the checkshould be turned off.<P>Several *CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL cards within one input deck defining severalcyclic symmetries within one and the same model are allowed. This, however,always is an approximation, since several cyclic symmetries within one modelcannot really exist. Good results are only feasible if the values of N for thedifferent *CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL cards do not deviate substantially.<P>The *CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL card triggers the creation of cyclic symmetrymultiple point constraints between the slave and master side. If the nodes donot match on a one-to-one basis a slave node is connected to a master face. Tothis end the master side is triangulated. The resulting triangulation isstored in file TriMasterCyclicSymmetryModel.frd and can be viewed withCalculiX GraphiX. <P>For 3D-fluid calculations there are two parameters, N and TIE. The parameterN, specifying the number of sectors, is required for calculations with arotational cyclic symmetry (FLUID CYCLIC parameter on the *TIEtiecard). The parameter TIE is required for both calculations with rotationalcyclic symmetry and translational cylic symmetry (FLUID PERIODIC parameter onthe *TIE card). For 3D-fluid calculations the slave and master surface mustconsist of matching faces.<P><P><P><BR>First line for all but fluid periodic calculations:<UL><LI>*CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL</LI><LI>Enter the required parameters N and TIE (the latter only if more than  one cyclic symmetry tie is defined) and their value.</LI></UL><P>Second line for all but fluid periodic calculations:<UL><LI>X-coordinate of point a.</LI><LI>Y-coordinate of point a.</LI><LI>Z-coordinate of point a.</LI><LI>X-coordinate of point b.</LI><LI>Y-coordinate of point b.</LI><LI>Z-coordinate of point b.</LI></UL><P><P><P><BR>First line for fluid periodic calculations:<UL><LI>*CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL</LI><LI>Enter the required parameter TIE and its value.</LI></UL><P>Second line for fluid periodic calculations:<UL><LI>X-coordinate of a vector pointing from the slave to the master surface.</LI><LI>Y-coordinate of a vector pointing from the slave to the master surface.</LI><LI>Z-coordinate of a vector pointing from the slave to the master surface.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
