The following variables can beselected:<P><UL><LI>Relative contact displacements (key=CDIS)</LI><LI>Contact stresses (key=CSTR)</LI><LI>Contact spring energy (key=CELS)</LI><LI>Total number of contact elements (key=CNUM)</LI></UL><P>Contact quantities are stored for all active slave nodes in the model fornode-to-face penalty contact and for all active integration points in the slaveface for face-to-face penalty contact. The relativecontact displacements and the stresses consist of one component normal to themaster surface and two components tangential to it. Positive values of the normal componentsrepresent the normal material overlap and the pressure, respectively. The energy is a scalar quantity.<P>There are three parameters, FREQUENCY, TIME POINTS and TOTALS. FREQUENCY andTIME POINTS are mutually exclusive. <P>The parameter FREQUENCY is optional, and applies tononlinear calculations where a step can consist of severalincrements. Default is FREQUENCY=1, which indicates that the resultsof all increments will be stored. FREQUENCY=N with N an integerindicates that the results of every Nth increment will be stored. Thefinal results of a step are always stored. If you only want the finalresults, choose N very big. The value of N applies to *OUTPUT,*ELEMENT OUTPUT, *EL FILE, *ELPRINT, *NODE OUTPUT,*NODE FILE, *NODE PRINT,*SECTION PRINT,*CONTACT OUTPUT,*CONTACT FILE and *CONTACT PRINT. If the FREQUENCY parameter is usedfor more than one of these keywords with conflicting values of N, thelast value applies to all. A frequency parameter stays active across several stepsuntil it is overwritten by another FREQUENCY value or the TIME POINTS parameter.<P>With the parameter TIME POINTS a time point sequence can be referenced,defined by a *TIME POINTS keyword. In that case, output will beprovided for all time points of the sequence within the step and additionally at the end ofthe step. No other output will be stored and the FREQUENCY parameter is nottaken into account. Within a step only one time point sequence can be active. If more thanone is specified, the last one defined on any of the keyword cards*NODE FILE, *EL FILE, *NODE  PRINT, *EL PRINT or *FACE  PRINT will be active. The TIMEPOINTS option should not be used together with the DIRECT option on theprocedure card. The TIME POINTS parameters stays active across several stepsuntil it is replaced by another TIME POINTS value or the FREQUENCY parameter.<P>The first occurrence of an *CONTACT PRINT keyword card within a step wipesout all previous contact variable selections for print output. If no*CONTACT PRINT card is used within a step the selections of the previousstep apply, if any.<P>The parameter TOTALS only applies to the energy. IfTOTALS=YES the sum of the contact spring energy for all contact definitions isprinted in addition to their value for each active slave node (node-to-facecontact) or active slave face integration point (face-to-face contact)separately. If TOTALS=ONLY is selected the sum is printed but theindividual contributions are not. If TOTALS=NO (default) theindividual contributions are printed, but their sum is not.<P>If the model contains axisymmetric elements the spring energy applies to asegment of <B><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img260.png" ALT="$ 2^\circ$"></B>. So for the total spring energy this value has to be multiplied by180. <P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*CONTACT PRINT</LI></UL>Second line:<UL><LI>Identifying keys for the variables to be printed, separated by commas.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
