A surface interaction data block is defined by the options betweena *SURFACE INTERACTION line and either another *SURFACE INTERACTION line or akeyword line that does not define surface interaction properties. All surfaceinteraction options within a data block will be assumed to define the samesurface interaction. If a property is defined more than once for a surfaceinteraction, the last definition is used. There is one required parameter,NAME, defining the name of the surface interaction with which it can bereferenced in surface interactions (e.g. *CONTACT PAIR). The name can containup to 80 characters.<P>If used for penalty contact the surface interaction definition must containa *SURFACE BEHAVIOR card.<P>Surface interaction data requests outside the defined ranges are extrapolated in a constant way. Be aware that this occasionally occurs due to rounding errors.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*SURFACE INTERACTION</LI><LI>Enter the NAME parameter and its value.</LI></UL><P><PRE>
