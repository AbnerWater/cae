The options and its use are identical with the*CONTACT FILE keyword, however, the resulting .frd file is amixture of binary and ASCII (the .frd file generated by using *CONTACT FILE iscompletely ASCII). This has the advantage that the file is smallerand can be faster read by cgx.<P>If FILE and OUTPUT cards are mixed within one and the same step the last suchcardwill determine whether the .frd file is completely in ASCII or a mixture ofbinary and ASCII.<P><PRE>
Example:

*CONTACT OUTPUT,TIME POINTS=T1
CDIS,CSTR
</PRE><P>requests the storage of the relative contact displacements and contactstresses in the .frdfile for all timepoints defined by the T1 time points sequence.<P><P><P><BR>Example files: .<P></body></html>
