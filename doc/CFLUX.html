Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, USER and ADD. OP can take thevalue NEW or MOD. OP=MOD is default and implies that the concentratedfluxes applied to different nodes in previous steps are kept. Specifying a flux in a node for which aflux was defined in a previous step replaces this  value. A flux specified ina node for which a flux was already defined within the same step is added tothis value. OP=NEWimplies that all concentrated fluxes applied in previous steps are removed. Ifmultiple *CFLUX cards are present in a step this parameter takes effect for the first *CFLUX card only. <P>The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitude by whichthe flux values are scaled (mainly used for nonlinear static and dynamiccalculations). Thus, in that case the values entered on the *CFLUX card areinterpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the (time dependent)amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At the end of the step thereference value is replaced by the actual value at that time. In subsequentsteps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or theamplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keepsits validity. <P>The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAYmust be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which theAMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. Forinstance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>If the USER parameter is selected the concentrated flux values are determined bycalling the user subroutine cflux.f, whichmust be provided by the user. This applies to all nodes listedbeneath the *CFLUX keyword. Any flux values specified following thetemperature degree of freedom are not taken into account. If the USER parameter is selected,the AMPLITUDE parameter has no effect and should not be used. <P>Finally, the ADD parameter allows the user to specify that the flux should beadded to previously defined fluxes in the same node, irrespective whetherthese fluxes were defined in the present step or in a previous step.<P>The use of the *CFLUX card makes sense for heat transfer calculationsor coupled thermo-mechanical calculations only. Heat fluxes areapplied to degree of freedom 11.<P>If more than one *CFLUX card occurs within the input deck the following rules apply:<P>If a *CFLUX card is applied to the same node AND in the same direction as in aprevious application, then<UL><LI>if the previous application was in the same step the *CFLUX value is  added, else it is replaced</LI><LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude</LI></UL><P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*CFLUX</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value.</LI></UL><P>Following line:<UL><LI>Node number or node set label.</LI><LI>Degree of freedom (11).</LI><LI>Magnitude of the flux</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>
