The load consists of thesum of the load of the last *STATIC step and the load specified in the presentstep with replacement of redefined loads. This card is also correct for steadystate incompressible flow calculations without heat transfer.<P>There are five optional parameters: SOLVER, DIRECT, EXPLICIT, TIME RESET andTOTAL TIME AT START. SOLVER determines thepackage used to solve the ensuing system of equations. The following solverscan be selected:<P><UL><LI>the SGI solver</LI><LI>PARDISO</LI><LI>SPOOLES [3,4]. </LI><LI>TAUCS </LI><LI>the iterative solver by Rank and Ruecker [65], which is based on  the algorithms by Schwarz [69]. </LI></UL><P>Default is the first solver which has been installed of the following list:SGI, PARDISO, SPOOLES and TAUCS. If none is installed, the default is the iterative solver, which comes with the CalculiXpackage.<P>The SGI solver should by now be considered as outdated. SPOOLES is very fast, but has noout-of-core capability: the size of systems you can solve is limited by yourRAM memory. With 2GB of RAM you can solve up to 250,000 equations. TAUCS isalso good, but my experience is limited to the <B><IMG WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1577.png" ALT="$ LL^T$"></B> decomposition, whichonly applies to positive definite systems. It has an out-of-core capabilityand also offers a <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1578.png" ALT="$ LU$"></B> decomposition, however, I was not able to run either ofthem so far. Next comes the iterative solver. If SOLVER=ITERATIVE SCALING isselected, the pre-conditioning is limited to a scaling of the diagonal terms,SOLVER=ITERATIVE CHOLESKY triggers Incomplete Choleskypre-conditioning. Cholesky pre-conditioning leads to a better convergence andmaybe to shorter execution times, however, it requires additional storageroughly corresponding to the non-zeros in the matrix. If you are short ofmemory, diagonal scaling might be your last resort. The iterative methodsperform well for truly three-dimensional structures. For instance,calculations for a hemisphere were about nine times faster with the ITERATIVESCALING solver, and three times faster with the ITERATIVE CHOLESKY solver thanwith SPOOLES. For two-dimensional structures such as plates or shells, theperformance might break down drastically and convergence often requires theuse of Cholesky pre-conditioning. SPOOLES (and any of the other direct solvers)performs well in most situations with emphasis on slender structures butrequires much more storage than the iterative solver. PARDISO is the Intel proprietary solver and is to my knowledgepresently the fastest.<P>The parameter DIRECT is relevant for nonlinear calculations only, andindicates that automatic incrementation should be switched off.<P>The parameter EXPLICIT is only important for fluid computations. If present,the fluid computation is explicit, else it is semi-implicit. Static structuralcomputations are always implicit.<P>The parameter TIME RESET can be used to force the total time at theend of the present step to coincide with the total time at the end of theprevious step. If there is no previous step the targeted total time iszero. If this parameter is absent the total time at the end of the present step is thetotal time at the end of the previous step plus the time period of the presentstep (2nd parameter underneath the *STATIC keyword). Consequently, if the timeat the end of the previous step is 10. and the present time period is 1., thetotal time at the end of the present step is 11. If the TIME RESET parameteris used, the total time at the beginning of the present step is 9. and at theend of the present step it will be 10. This is sometimes useful ifthermomechanical calculations are split into transient heat transfer stepsfollowed by quasi-static static steps (this can be faster than using the*COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT option, which forces the same amount ofiterations for the thermal as for the mechanical calculations and than usingthe *UNCOUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT option, which forces the same amountof increments for the thermal as for the mechanical calculations). In CalculiX the static step needs afinite time period, however, the user frequently does not want the quasi-staticstep to change the time count.<P>Finally, the parameter TOTAL TIME AT START can be used to set the total timeat the start of the step to a specific value.<P>In a static step, loads are by default applied in a linear way. Other loadingpatterns can be defined by an *AMPLITUDE card.<P>If nonlinearities are present in the model (geometric nonlinearity or materialnonlinearity), the solution is obtained through iteration. Since the step maybe too large to obtain convergence, a subdivision of the step in increments isusually necessary. The user can define the length of the initialincrement. This size is kept constant if the parameter DIRECT is selected,else it is varied by CalculiX according to the convergence properties of thesolution. In a purely linear calculation the step size is always 1., noiterations are performed and, consequently, no second line underneath *STATICis needed. <P>Notice that any creep behavior (e.g. by using the keyword*CREEP) is switched off in a *STATIC step. To include creepuse the *VISCO keyword. The syntax for both keywords is the same.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*STATIC</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values.</LI></UL>Second line (only relevant for nonlinear analyses; for linear analyses, thestep length is always 1)<UL><LI>Initial time increment.

</PRE><P>defines a static step and selects the SPOOLES solver as linear equation solver in the step (default). If the step is a linear one, the other parameters are of no importance. If the step is nonlinear, the second line indicates that the initial time increment is .1 and the total step time is 1. Furthermore, the parameter DIRECT leads to a fixed time increment. Thus, if successful, the calculation consists of 10 increments of length 0.1.<P><P><P><BR>Example files: beampic, beampis.<P></body></html>
