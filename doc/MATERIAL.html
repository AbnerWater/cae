A material data block is defined by the options between a *MATERIAL line and either another *MATERIAL line or a keyword line that does not define material properties. All material options within a data block will be assumed to define the same material. If a property is defined more than once for a material, the last definition is used. There is one required parameter, NAME, defining the name of the material with which it can be referenced in element property options (e.g. *SOLID SECTION). The name can contain up to 80 characters.  <P> Material data requests outside the defined ranges are extrapolated in a constant way and a warning is generated. Be aware that this occasionally occurs due to rounding errors.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*MATERIAL </LI> <LI>Enter the NAME parameter and its value. </LI> </UL>  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*MATERIAL,NAME=EL
