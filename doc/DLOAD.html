These includeconstant pressure loading on element faces, edge loading on shells and mass loading (load per unitmass) either by gravity forces or by centrifugal forces. <P>For surface loading the faces of the elements are numbered as follows (for thenode numbering of the elements see Section 3.1):<P>for hexahedral elements:<P><UL><LI>face 1: 1-2-3-4</LI><LI>face 2: 5-8-7-6</LI><LI>face 3: 1-5-6-2</LI><LI>face 4: 2-6-7-3</LI><LI>face 5: 3-7-8-4</LI><LI>face 6: 4-8-5-1</LI></UL><P>for tetrahedral elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3</LI><LI>Face 2: 1-4-2</LI><LI>Face 3: 2-4-3</LI><LI>Face 4: 3-4-1</LI></UL><P>for wedge elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3</LI><LI>Face 2: 4-5-6</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-2-5-4</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-3-6-5</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-1-4-6</LI></UL>for quadrilateral plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 3: 3-4</LI><LI>Face 4: 4-1</LI></UL><P>for triangular plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 3: 3-1</LI></UL><P>for beam elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: pressure in 1-direction</LI><LI>Face 2: pressure in 2-direction</LI></UL><P>For shell elements no face number is needed since there is only one kind of loading:pressure in the direction of the normal on the shell. <P>The surface loading is entered as a uniform pressure with distributedload type label Px where x is the number of the face. Thus, forpressure loading the magnitude of the load is positive, for tensionloading it is negative. For nonuniform pressure the label takes theform PxNUy, and the user subroutine dload.f must be provided. The label can be up to 20 characters long. Inparticular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform loadingpatterns (maximum 16 characters). A typicalexample of a nonuniform loading is the hydrostatic pressure. Another option is to assign the pressure of a fluid node to an elementside. In that case the label takes the form PxNP, where NP stands for networkpressure. The fluid node must be an corner node of a network element. Instead of aconcrete pressure value the user must provide the fluid node number.<P>Edge loading is only provided for shell elements. Its units are force per unitlength. The label is EDNORx where x can take a value between one and three fortriangular shells and between one and four for quadrilateral shells. This typeof loading is locally orthogonal to the edge. Internally, it is replaced by apressure load, since shell elements in CalculiX are expanded into volumetric elements. Thenumbering is as follows:<P>for triangular shell elements:<UL><LI>Edge 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Edge 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Edge 3: 3-1</LI></UL><P>for quadrilateral shell elements:<UL><LI>Edge 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Edge 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Edge 3: 3-4</LI><LI>Edge 4: 4-1</LI></UL><P>For centrifugal loading (label CENTRIF) the rotational speed square (<B><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img1573.png" ALT="$ \omega^2$"></B>) and twopoints on the rotation axis are required, for gravity loading with knowngravity vector (label GRAV) the size and direction of the gravity vector are to begiven. Whereas more than one centrifugal load for one and the same set is notallowed, several gravity loads can be defined, provided the direction of theload varies. If the gravity vector is not known it can be calculated based on themomentaneous mass distribution of the system (label NEWTON). This requires thevalue of the Newton gravity constant by means of a *PHYSICAL  CONSTANTS card.<P>The limit of one centrifugal load per set does not apply to linear dynamic(*MODAL DYNAMIC) and steady state (*STEADY  STATE DYNAMICS) calculations. Here, the limit is two. In this way arotating eccentricity can be modeled. Prerequisite for the centrifugal loads tobe interpreted as distinct is the choice of distinct rotation axes.<P>Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, LOAD CASE and SECTOR. OP takes the value NEW orMOD. OP=MOD is default. For surface loads it implies that the loads on different faces are kept from the previous step. Specifying adistributed load on a face for which such a load was defined in aprevious step replaces this value, if a load was defined on the same facewithin the same step it is added. OP=NEW implies that all previoussurface loading is removed. For mass loading the effect is similar. If multiple *DLOAD cards are present in astep this parameter takes effect for the first *DLOAD card only. <P>The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitudeby which the force values are scaled (mainly used for dynamiccalculations). Thus, in that case the values entered on the *DLOADcard are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At theend of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value atthat time. In subsequentsteps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or theamplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keepsits validity. For nonuniform loading theAMPLITUDE parameter has no effect.<P>The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAYmust be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which theAMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. Forinstance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>The LOAD CASE parameter is only active in *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS calculations with harmonic loading. LOAD CASE = 1 means that the loading is real or in-phase.  LOAD CASE = 2 indicates that the load is imaginary or equivalently phase-shifted by <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img570.png" ALT="$ 90 ^\circ$"></B>. Default is LOAD CASE = 1. <P>The SECTOR parameter can only be used in *MODALDYNAMIC and *STEADY STATEDYNAMICS calculations with cyclic symmetry. The datumsector (the sector which is modeled) is sector 1. The other sectors arenumbered in increasing order in the rotational direction going from the slavesurface to the master surface as specified by the *TIEcard. Consequently, the SECTOR parameters allows to apply a distributed load to anyelement face in any sector.<P>Notice that in case an element set is used on any line following *DLOAD thisset should not contain elements from more than one of the following groups:{plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric elements}, {beams, trusses},{shells, membranes}, {volumetric elements}.<P>If more than one *DLOAD card occurs within the input deck, or a *DLOAD and atleast one*DSLOAD card, the following rules apply:<P>If a *DLOAD or *DSLOAD with label P1 up to P6 or EDNOR1 up to EDNOR4 or BF isapplied to an element for which a *DLOAD or *DSLOAD with the SAME label wasalready applied before, then<UL><LI>if the previous application was in the same step the load value is  added, else it is replaced</LI><LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude</LI></UL><P>If a *DLOAD with label CENTRIF is applied to the same set AND with the same rotation axis as in a previous application, then<UL><LI>If the prevous application was in the same step, the CENTRIF value is added, else it is replaced</LI><LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude</LI></UL><P>If a *DLOAD with label GRAV is applied to the same set AND with the same gravity direction vector as in a previous application, then<UL><LI>If the prevous application was in the same step, the GRAV value is added, else it is replaced</LI><LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude</LI></UL><P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*DLOAD</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value</LI></UL><P>Following line for surface loading:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Distributed load type label.</LI><LI>Actual magnitude of the load (for Px type labels) or fluid node number (for PxNU type labels)</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>
