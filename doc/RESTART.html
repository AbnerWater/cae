This is where the *RESTART keyword comesin. It can be used to store results for a later restart, or tocontinue a previous calculation. <P>There is one required parameter specifying whether you want to readprevious results (READ) or store the results of the presentcalculation for future restarts (WRITE). This parameter must followimmediately after the *RESTART keyword card.<P>If you specify READ, you canindicate with the parameter STEP which step of the previous run is tobe read. The results will be read from the binary file``jobname.rin'' which should have been generated in a previousrun. If the STEP parameter is absent the last step stored in the restart fileis taken. A restart file can contain any number of steps and anythingwhich is allowed within a step. For instance, one can define new loadsbased on sets generated in previous runs. If present, the *RESTART,READ linemust be the first non-comment line in the input deck.<P>If you specify WRITE, you canspecify the frequency (parameter FREQUENCY) at which results arestored. A frequency of two means that the results of every second step will bestored. Default is one. The results will be stored in binary format infile ``jobname.rout''. Any existing file with this name will bedeleted prior to the first writing operation. The restart file is beingwritten starting with the step in which the *RESTART card appears and is beingcontinued up to the step in which the *RESTART card is reused, if any. A reuseof the *RESTART card can be useful in case the user does not want any furthersteps to be stored in the restart file (FREQUENCY=0), or in case he/she wants tochange the write frequency. <P>In order to prevent the restart file to be come too big, the user can specifythe parameter OVERLAY for the *RESTART,WRITE combination. In that case everynew step being written to the restart file will delete all previousinformation. So only the last step written to file will be available for anysubsequent reuse by a *RESTART,READ command.<P>For a subsequent restart job with name``jobname_new.inp'' the ``jobname.rout'' file must be renamed into``jobname_new.rin''. The *RESTART,WRITE combination must be used within a*STEP definition<P><P><BR><P>First and only line:<UL><LI>*RESTART</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values</LI></UL><P><PRE>
