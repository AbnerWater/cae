Notice that a *TRANSFORM card is notallowed for nodes in which boundary conditions are applied to rotations.<P>Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, LOAD CASE, USER, MASS FLOW,FIXED, SUBMODEL, STEP and DATA SET. OP can take the value NEW orMOD. OP=MOD is default and implies that previously prescribeddisplacements remain active in subsequent steps. Specifying adisplacement in the same node and direction for which a displacementwas defined in a previous step replaces this  value. OP=NEW impliesthat previously prescribed displacements are removed. If multiple*BOUNDARY cards are present in a step this parameter takes effect for the first *BOUNDARY card only. <P>The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitude by which the boundary values are scaled (mainly used for nonlinear static and dynamic calculations). This only makes sense for nonzero boundary values. Thus, in that case the values entered on the *BOUNDARY card are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the (time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At the end of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value at that time. In subsequentsteps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or theamplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keepsits validity.<P>The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAYmust be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which theAMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. Forinstance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>The LOAD CASE parameter is only active in *STEADY STATEDYNAMICS calculations. LOAD CASE = 1 means that theloading is real or in-phase.  LOAD CASE = 2 indicates that the load isimaginary or equivalently phase-shifted by <B><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="img570.png" ALT="$ 90 ^\circ$"></B>. Default is LOAD CASE =1.<P>If the USER parameter is selected the boundary values are determined bycalling the user subroutine uboun.f, whichmust be provided by the user. This applies to all nodes listedbeneath the *BOUNDARY keyword. Any boundary values specified behind thedegrees of freedom are not taken into account. If the USER parameter is selected,the AMPLITUDE parameter has no effect and should not be used.<P>The MASS FLOW parameter specifies that the *BOUNDARY keyword is usedto define mass flow rates in convective problems. A mass flow rate can only beapplied to the first degree of freedom of the midside node of network elements. <P>Next, the FIXED parameter freezes the deformation from the previous step,or, if there is no previous step, sets it to zero.<P>Finally, the SUBMODEL parameter specifies that the displacements in the nodeslisted underneath will be obtained by interpolation from a global model. Tothis end these nodes have to be part of a*SUBMODEL,TYPE=NODE card. On the latter card the resultfile (frd file) of the global model is defined. The use of the SUBMODELparameter requires the STEP or the DATA SET parameter. <P>In case the globalcalculation was a *STATIC calculation the STEP parameter specifies the step in the global modelwhich will be used for the interpolation. If results for more than oneincrement within the step are stored, the last increment is taken. <P>In case the global calculation was a *FREQUENCY calculation the DATA SET parameterspecifies the mode in the global model which will be used for theinterpolation. It is the number preceding the string MODAL in the .frd-fileand it corresponds to the dataset number if viewing the .frd-file withCalculiX GraphiX.  Notice that the global frequency calculation is not allowedto contain preloading nor cyclic symmetry.<P>Notice that the displacementsinterpolated fromthe global model are not transformed, no matter what coordinate system isapplied to the nodes in the submodel. Consequently, if the displacements of the global modelare stored in a local coordinate system, this local system also applies to thesubmodel nodes in which these displacements are interpolated. Sothe submodel nodes in which the displacements of the global model areinterpolated, inherit the coordinate system in which the displacements of theglobal model were stored. The SUBMODEL parameter and the AMPLITUDE parameterare mutually exclusive.<P>If more than one *BOUNDARY card occurs in the input deck, the following ruleapplies: if the *BOUNDARY is applied to the same node AND in the samedirection as in a previous application then the previous value and previousamplitude are replaced.<P>A distinction is made whether the conditions are homogeneous (fixedconditions),  inhomogeneous (prescribed displacements) or of the submodel type.<P></body></html>
