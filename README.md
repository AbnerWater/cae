# CalculiX CAE

GUI/pre-processor for [CalculiX CrunchiX](http://dhondt.de/). Very simple, free and open source. Program is based on CalculiX keywords hierarchy. Written in Python3, utilizes PyQt5 and VTK.

It is implied that you have already created geometry and generated mesh in some other software like [Salome-platform](https://www.salome-platform.org/). CacluliX CAE is designed to guide you through the keywords creation sequence and is aimed to help you reach correct input file with no mistakes.

<br/><br/>



# Features

- Calculix keywords hierarchy with all attributes is maintaned in simple editable text file - [ccx_dom.inp](ccx_dom.inp). "New keyword" dialog is based on it.

- "New keyword" dialog shows apropriate chapter of the official HTML documentation.

- Import/export of .inp-files - one format for all needs. Program parses .inp-file and generates model on the fly, so separate format for the model is not needed. Final model is saved also with .inp format ready to be calculated by ccx.

- Solid mesh parser - [ccx_mesh.py](ccx_mesh.py) - tested on the all example CacluliX models - with ability to highlight surfaces, node and element sets after mesh import. See [tests.log](tests.log).

- Nice icons for all keywords/tree objects.

- Run job analysis and call GraphiX directly from GUI.

- Application's global settings are maintained in text file [ccx_settings.env](ccx_settings.env) with Python syntax. Settings are automatically saved during the workflow.

# Downloads

Both sources and binaries could be found on [the releases page](https://github.com/imirzov/ccx_cae/releases).

<br/><br/>



# How to use

CacluliX CAE is portable software and doesn't need to be installed. Just extract archive, make binary executable and run it with double click. To submit analysis from CAE and view results in GraphiX configure path to your CalculiX binaries in ccx_settings.env.

The intended workflow is:
- create geometry and mesh in [Salome-platform](https://www.salome-platform.org/),
- save mesh as UNV or export it to INP with [SalomeToCalculix GUI tool](https://github.com/psicofil/SalomeToCalculix),
- import INP or UNV mesh to CAE and continue creating model, submit job from CAE,
- export job result to the Paraview post-processor or view it in GraphiX.

CaculiX CAE supports INP and UNV model formats. Pass name of your model as an argument to open it at start:

    in Linux:       ./ccx_cae -inp model.inp
                    ./ccx_cae -inp model.unv
    in Windows:     ccx_cae.exe -inp model.inp
                    ccx_cae.exe -inp model.unv

# Your help

Please, you may:

- Simply use this software and ask questions.
- Share your models and screenshots.
- Report problems by [posting issues](https://github.com/imirzov/ccx_cae/issues).
- Do something from the [TODO-list](#TODO).

# For developers

Suppose you already have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Install dependancies with command:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Run source code with one of the commands:

    python3 ccx_cae.py
    python3 ccx_cae.py -inp model.inp
    python3 ccx_cae.py -inp model.unv

Use [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) or [release_binaries.py](release_binaries.py) to create releases:

    pyinstaller ccx_cae.py
    python3 release_binaries.py

CalculiX CAE uses external converters:
- [ccx2paraview](https://github.com/imirzov/ccx2paraview) - CalculiX to Paraview converter (frd to vtk/vtu)
- [unv2ccx](https://github.com/imirzov/unv2ccx) - Salome universal to CalculiX converter (unv to inp)

# TODO

**Done for the next release**

- New context menu for job: Open in Paraview.

- Fixed UnicodeDecodeError during file parse. Implemented binary INP file reading.

- Fixed 100% CPU usage during using Paraview and GraphiX.

- Fixed error in mesh parser and VTK selections: now names can contain symbol '-'.

**Improvements and bugfixes**

- Better ViewSurfaceWithEdges - implement it manually without EdgeVisibilityOn().

- Better surface highlight: remove original face for pure color.

- During keyword's edit parse arguments and pass them to Dialog. Reparse mesh objects after edit.  

**New features**

- treeView: show implementations only.

- PDF manual or YouTube videos for beginners.

- Visualize BC's, constraints and loads in VTK.

- Python code (*PYTHON keyword) in INP_code for step repetition and other kind of model generation.

- Import certain keyword with descendants (tree branch) from INP-file.

- Interface for materials import. Enrich Materials library.

- Import mesh from FRD, [VTK](https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Python/IO/ReadLegacyUnstructuredGrid/), [VTU](https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Python/IO/ReadUnstructuredGrid/), [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/).

- Prool's INP-templates and snippets.

- Include Martin Kraska examples.

- Menu Help: VTK Keyboard Shortcuts and Controls.
