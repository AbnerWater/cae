# CalculiX CAE

GUI/pre-processor for [CalculiX CrunchiX](http://dhondt.de/). Very simple, free and open source. Program is based on CalculiX keywords hierarchy. Written in Python3, utilizes PyQt5 and VTK.

It is implied that you have already created geometry and generated mesh in some other software like [Salome-platform](https://www.salome-platform.org/). CacluliX CAE is designed to guide you through the keywords creation sequence and is aimed to help you reach correct input file with no mistakes.

<br/><br/>



# Features

- Calculix keywords hierarchy with all attributes is maintaned in simple editable text file - [ccx_dom.inp](ccx_dom.inp). Keyword's edit dialog is based on it.

- Import/export of .inp-files - one format for all needs. Program parses .inp-file and generates model on the fly, so separate format for the model is not needed. Final model is saved also with .inp format ready to be calculated by ccx.

- Solid mesh parser - [ccx_mesh.py](ccx_mesh.py) - tested on the all example CacluliX models - with ability to highlight surfaces, node and element sets after mesh import. See [tests.log](tests.log).

- "New keyword" dialog shows apropriate chapter of the official HTML documentation. The dialog is generated on the fly reading keyword's attributes from [ccx_dom.inp](ccx_dom.inp).

- Nice icons for all keywords/tree objects.

- Run job analysis directly from CAE.

- Application's global settings are maintained in text file [Settings.env](Settings.env) with Python syntax. Settings are automatically saved during the workflow.

# How to use

First, to run analysis from CAE configure path to CalculiX in Settings.env.

Despite of your operating system it is recommended to use the source code - simply call [ccx_cae.py](ccx_cae.py) from terminal. Otherwise you may [download binaries](./releases). CacluliX CAE is portable software and doesn't need to be installed. Just extract archive and run *ccx_cae* or *ccx_cae.exe*. Don't forget to make all binaries executable.

    crossplatform: python3 ccx_cae.py
    in Linux:      ./ccx_cae
    in Windows:    ccx_cae.exe

Pass name of your INP file as an argument to open it at start:

    crossplatform: python3 ccx_cae.py -inp your_model.inp
    in Linux: ./ccx_cae -inp your_model.inp
    in Windows: ccx_cae.exe -inp your_model.inp

<br/><br/>



# Downloads

Both sources and binaries could be found on [the releases page](./releases).

<br/><br/>



# Your help

Please, you may:

- Simply use this software and ask questions.
- Share your models and screenshots.
- Report problems by [posting issues](./issues).
- Do something from the [TODO-list](#TODO).
- Follow discussion in the [Yahoo CalculiX Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CALCULIX/conversations/topics/15616)

<br/><br/>



# For developers

Suppose you already have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). So first of all install VTK, PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine:

    pip3 install vtk PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine

That's all if you're going only to use CalculiX CAE.

For developers to edit GUI-forms [ccx_dialog.ui](ccx_dialog.ui) and [ccx_cae.ui](ccx_cae.ui) you'll need QT designer:

    sudo apt install qttools5-dev-tools

To create release binaries install [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/):

    pip3 install pyinstaller

Then create release binaries with command:

    pyinstaller ccx_cae.py

<br/><br/>



# TODO

**Improvements and bugfixes**

- Better ViewSurfaceWithEdges - implement it manually without EdgeVisibilityOn().

- Better surface highlight: remove original face for pure color.

- During keyword's edit parse arguments and pass them to Dialog. Reparse mesh objects after edit.  
Error: create new set and highlight it

- Notify on job completion.

- Convert calculation results.

**New features**

- User control for the font size.

- PDF manual for beginners: "I am not quite sure, what the intended workflow is. I'd expect some representation (object tree) of what has been imported and/or has been already defined. The tree in the CAE window seems to be just sort of a menu but not an actual object tree."

- Visualize BC's, constraints and loads in VTK.

- Python code (*PYTHON keyword) in INP_code for step repetition and other kind of model generation.

- Import certain keyword with descendants (tree branch) from INP-file. Interface for materials import. Enrich Materials library.

- Import mesh from FRD, [VTK](https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Python/IO/ReadLegacyUnstructuredGrid/), [VTU](https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Python/IO/ReadUnstructuredGrid/), [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/), [UNV](https://github.com/imirzov/unv2ccx).

- Prool's INP-templates and snippets.

- Include Martin Kraska examples.

- Menu Help: VTK Keyboard Shortcuts and Controls.
