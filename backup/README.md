# CalculiX CAE

GUI/pre-processor for CalculiX CrunchiX. Very simple, lightweight, free and open source. It is implied that you have already created geometry and generated mesh in some other software like Salome-platform.

Program is based on CalculiX 2.15 keywords hierarchy. Written in Python3. Implements PyQt5 and VTK.

<br/><br/>



# Info for developers

To contribute first install vtk, PyQt5 and QT designer:

    pip3 install vtk
    pip3 install PyQt5
    sudo apt install qttools5-dev-tools

Some examples for getting started with VTK in Python:

# TODO

Show final INP_code

Remember collapsed/expanded state for each treeView item - keep it after tree regeneration.

Move importINP to ccx_inp.py.

Get all mutually exclusive arguments from the manual - now they are supported.

Styles for treeView elements.

Show PDF documentation for each keyword's dialog.

Save display options.

Comments code

Python code (*PYTHON keyword) in INP_code for step repetition and other kind of model generation.

Parse keyword's arguments and pass them to Dialog
